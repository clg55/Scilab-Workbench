  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>
     This function may be used to generate random numbers from various distributions. In this 
     case you must apply one of the 
     <VERB>three first forms</VERB> of the possible calling sequences to get an <VERB>m x n</VERB> matrix. 
     The two firsts are equivalent if <VERB>X</VERB> is a <VERB>m x n</VERB> matrix, 
     and the third form corresponds to 'multivalued' distributions (e.g. multinomial, multivariate
     gaussian, etc...) where a sample is a column vector (says of dim <VERB>m</VERB>)
     and you get then <VERB>n</VERB> such random vectors (as an <VERB> m x n</VERB> matrix). 
     <VERB>The last form</VERB> is used to undertake various manipulations onto the base generators
     like changing the base generator (since v 2.7 you may choose between several base generators), 
     changing or retrieving its internal state (seeds), etc ... These base generators give random
     integers following a uniform distribution on a large integer interval (lgi), all the others 
     distributions being gotten from it (in general via a scheme lgi -&gt; U([0,1)) -&gt; wanted distribution).

  <SECTION label="Test example for clcg4">
    <P>
    An example of  the  need of the splitting capabilities of clcg4 is as  follows. 
    Two statistical techniques are being compared on  data of  different sizes. The first 
    technique uses   bootstrapping  and is   thought to   be  as accurate using less data   
    than the second method   which  employs only brute force.  For the first method, a data
    set of size uniformly distributed between 25 and 50 will be generated.  Then the data set  
    of the specified size will be generated and analyzed.  The second method will  choose a 
    data set size between 100 and 200, generate the data  and analyze it.  This process will 
    be repeated 1000 times.  For  variance reduction, we  want the  random numbers  used in the 
    two methods to be the  same for each of  the 1000 comparisons.  But method two will  use more
    random  numbers than   method one and  without this package, synchronization might be difficult.  
    With clcg4, it is a snap.  Use generator 0 to obtain  the sample size for  method one and 
    generator 1  to obtain the  data.  Then reset the state to the beginning  of the current  block
    and do the same  for the second method.  This assures that the initial data  for method two is 
    that used by  method  one.  When both  have concluded,  advance the block for both generators.</P>
