  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="mtlb_norm">Matlab norm emulation function</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>

    <P>Matlab and Scilab <VERB>norm</VERB> behave differently in some particular cases:</P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
    <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    <ITEMIZE>
      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        For the <VERB>-%inf</VERB> norm: Matlab <VERB>norm</VERB> can process the <VERB>-%inf</VERB>
	norm of a matrix but not Scilab <VERB>norm</VERB>.

    <P>
    The function <VERB>mtlb_norm(A,p)</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>norm(A,p)</VERB> when it was not
    possible to know what were the inputs while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
    determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
    more efficient code it is possible to replace <VERB>mtlb_norm</VERB> calls:
    </P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
    <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    <ITEMIZE>
      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        If <VERB>A</VERB> is a vector or a scalar and whatever <VERB>p</VERB> is
        <VERB>mtlb_norm(A,p)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>norm(A,p)</VERB>
        </SP>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        If <VERB>p</VERB> is not equal to <VERB>-%inf</VERB> and whatever <VERB>A</VERB> is
        <VERB>mtlb_norm(A,p)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>norm(A,p)</VERB>
        </SP>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        If <VERB>p</VERB> is equal to <VERB>-%inf</VERB> and <VERB>A</VERB> is a matrix
        <VERB>mtlb_norm(A,p)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>max(sum(abs(A'),1))</VERB>
        </SP>
      </ITEM>

    </DESCRIPTION_INDENT>

    <P>Caution: <VERB>mtlb_norm</VERB> has not to be used for hand coded functions.</P>
