  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="champ_properties"> description of the 2D vector field
   entity properties</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>
  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>
  The Champ entity is a leaf of the graphics entities
  hierarchy. This entity defines the parameters for a 2D vector field.
  </P>
    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="visible: ">
        <SP>This properties contains the  <VERB>visible</VERB> property value
   for the entity . It should
   be <VERB>&quot;on&quot; </VERB> or <VERB>&quot;off&quot;</VERB>  . If <VERB>&quot;on&quot;
   </VERB> the vector field is drawn, If
   <VERB>&quot;off&quot;</VERB> the vector field is not displayed on the screen.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="data: ">
        <P>
    This property represent a matrix  <VERB>[x,y,fx,fy]</VERB> <VERB>x</VERB>
    where <VERB>y</VERB> gives the coordinates of the champ boundary.
    If  <VERB>xv=matrix(x,2,-1)</VERB> and
    <VERB>yv=matrix(y,2,-1)</VERB> the two vectors <VERB>xv(:,k)</VERB> and
    <VERB>yv(:,k)</VERB> are the boundary coordinates of the segments
    numbered  <VERB>k</VERB>.
    <VERB>fx</VERB> and <VERB>fy</VERB> are two square matrices
    which are the x and y components of the fields value at each given point.</P>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="line_style: ">
        <SP>The  <VERB>line_style</VERB> property value should be an integer in [0 9].
       0 stands for solid the other value stands for a selection of
       dashes. This property applies to all lines used to draw the vector field.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="thickness: ">
        <SP>This property contains the  <VERB>thickness</VERB> property for
       all lines used to draw the vector field. Its value should
       be a non negative integer..</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="colored: ">
        <SP>If this this property value is <VERB>&quot;on&quot;</VERB>, fields vectors
      are drawn using a color proportional to the intensity of the field.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="clip_state: ">
        <SP>This field contains the <VERB>clip_state</VERB> property
      value for the champ.  It should be :</SP>
        <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
          <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
            <P><VERB>&quot;off&quot;</VERB> this means that the vector field is not clipped
         </P>
          </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
          <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
            <P><VERB>&quot;clipgrf&quot;</VERB> this means that the
         vector field is clipped outside the Axes box.
         </P>
          </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
          <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
            <P><VERB>&quot;on&quot;</VERB> this means that the
         vector field is clipped outside the rectangle given by property clip_box.
         </P>
          </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
        </DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="clip_box: ">
        <SP>This property contains the  <VERB>clip_box</VERB> property.
      Its value should be an empty matrix if
      clip_state is &quot;off&quot; .Other cases the vector <VERB>[x,y,w,h]</VERB> (upper-left point width height) 
       defines the portions of the vector field to display, however <VERB>clip_state</VERB> property 
       value will be changed.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="parent: ">
        <SP>This property contains the handle of the parent. The parent of the 2D vector field
      entity should be of the type <VERB>&quot;Axes&quot;</VERB> or <VERB>&quot;Agregation&quot;</VERB>.</SP>
