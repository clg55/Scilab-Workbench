   Polyline entity properties </SHORT_DESCRIPTION>
 
  <DESCRIPTION>
  <P>
  The Polyline entity is a leaf of the graphics entities
  hierarchy. This entity defines the parameters for polylines.
  </P>
  <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
   <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="visible: ">
    <SP>This field contains the  <VERB>visible</VERB> property value
   for the entity . It should
   be <VERB>&quot;on&quot; </VERB> or <VERB>&quot;off&quot;</VERB>  . By default, 
   the polyline is visible, the value's property is  <VERB>&quot;on&quot;
   </VERB>. If <VERB>&quot;off&quot;</VERB> the polyline is not drawn on the screen.</SP>
   </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>


   <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="data: ">
    <SP>This field contains the  values for the x and y coordinates. 
    Component Z is to be added in the case of three-dimensional axes. 
    It is a two (three) column matrix <VERB>[x,y,[z]]</VERB> of points.</SP>
   </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

    <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="line_style: ">
      <SP>The  <VERB>line_style</VERB> property value should be an integer in [0 9].
       0 stands for solid the other value stands for a selection of
       dashes.</SP>
     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="thickness: ">
       <SP>This field contains the line <VERB>thickness</VERB> property. It's value should
       be positive integer.</SP>
     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>


     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="polyline_style: ">
      <SP>This property sets several polyline drawing mode:</SP>
     <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
        <DESCRIPTION_ITEM> 
        <SP>If the value is 0 or 1 lines are drawn between two consecutives points.</SP>
        </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
	<DESCRIPTION_ITEM> 
        <SP>If the value is 2 the polyline produces a staircase plot. Two
        consecutives points are linked by an horizontal line followed
        by a vertical line.</SP>
        </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
	<DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
        <SP>If the value is 3 the polyline produces a bar plot. For each
        given point (x,y) a vertical line is drawn from (x,y) to (x,0).</SP>
        </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
        <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
         <SP>If the value is 4 arrows are drawn between two consecutives points.</SP>
        </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
	  <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
         <SP>If the value is 5 the polyline is filled (patch).</SP>
        </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
     </DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>


     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_mode: ">
      <SP>If <VERB>mark_mode</VERB> property is  <VERB>&quot;on&quot; </VERB> the
      polyline  is represented by a mark drawn at each given
      points. If is the default value <VERB>&quot;off&quot;</VERB> 
      the polyline is represented using lines.</SP>
     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_style: ">
      <SP>The <VERB>mark_style</VERB> property value is used to select the
       type of mark to use when <VERB>mark_mode</VERB> property is 
       <VERB>&quot;on&quot; </VERB>. The value should be an integer in [0 9]
       which stands for: dot, plus, cross, star, diamond fill, diamond,
       triangle up, triangle down, trefle and circle.</SP>
     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_size: ">
      <SP>The <VERB>mark_size</VERB> property  is used to select the
       type of size of the marks when <VERB>mark_mode</VERB> property is
       <VERB>&quot;on&quot; </VERB>. Its value should be an integer between 0 and 5
       whith stands for 8pt, 10pt, 12pt, 14pt, 18pt and 24pt.</SP>
     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="foreground: ">  
     <SP>This field contains the default <VERB>foreground</VERB> property
      used to draw the polyline. Its value should be a color index
      (relative to the current colormap).</SP>
     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="clip_state: ">
      <SP>This field contains the <VERB>clip_state</VERB> property
      value for the polyline.  It should be :</SP>
      <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
         <DESCRIPTION_ITEM > 
         <SP><VERB>&quot;off&quot;</VERB> this means that the polyline is not clipped.</SP>
         </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

         <DESCRIPTION_ITEM > 
         <SP><VERB>&quot;clipgrf&quot;</VERB> this means that the
         polyline is clipped outside the Axes box.</SP>
         </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

        <DESCRIPTION_ITEM > 
         <SP><VERB>&quot;on&quot;</VERB> this means that the
         polyline is clipped outside the rectangle given by property clip_box.</SP>
         </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
      </DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="clip_box: ">   
     <SP>This field is to determinate  the  <VERB>clip_box</VERB> property.
      By Default its value should be an empty matrix if clip_state is &quot;off&quot;.
       Other cases the vector <VERB>[x,y,w,h]</VERB> (upper-left point width height) 
       defines the portions  of the polyline to display, however <VERB>clip_state</VERB> property 
       value will be changed.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM> 

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="parent: "> 
      <SP>This field contains the handle of the parent. The parent of the polyline
      entity should be of the type <VERB>&quot;Axes&quot;</VERB> or <VERB>&quot;Agregation&quot;</VERB>.</SP>
