  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="mtlb_all">Matlab all emulation function</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>

    <P>Matlab <VERB>all</VERB> and Scilab <VERB>and</VERB> behave differently in some particular cases:</P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
    <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    <ITEMIZE>
      <ITEM>
        <SP>
	When used with one input (<VERB>all(A)</VERB>), Matlab <VERB>all</VERB> treats the values along the first
	non-singleton dimension of A as vectors while Scilab <VERB>and</VERB> treats all A values.
	</SP>
      </ITEM>
	
      <ITEM>
        <SP>
	When used with two inputs (<VERB>all(A,dim)</VERB>), Matlab tolerates <VERB>dim</VERB> to be greater than
	the number of dimensions of A while Scilab returns an error message in this case.
        </SP>
      </ITEM>
    </ITEMIZE>
    </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    </DESCRIPTION_INDENT>

    <P>
    The function <VERB>R = mtlb_all(A[,dim])</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>all(A[,dim])</VERB> when it was not
    possible to know what were the inputs while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
    determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
    more efficient code it is possible to replace <VERB>mtlb_all</VERB> calls:
    </P>

    <ITEMIZE>
      <ITEM>
        <SP>    
	If <VERB>A</VERB> is a scalar or a vector
	<VERB>R = mtlb_all(A)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>R = and(A)</VERB>
	</SP>      
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM>
        <SP>
	If <VERB>A</VERB> is a matrix
	<VERB>R = mtlb_all(A)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>R = and(A,1)</VERB>
	</SP>      
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM>
        <SP>
	If <VERB>A</VERB> is an hypermatrix
	<VERB>R = mtlb_all(A)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>R = and(A,firstnonsingleton(A))</VERB>
	or by <VERB>R = and(A,user_defined_value)</VERB> if the first non-singleton dimensions of A is known.
	</SP>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM>
        <SP>
	If <VERB>dim</VERB> is less equal to the number of dimensions of A
	<VERB>R = mtlb_all(A,dim)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>R = and(A,dim)</VERB>
	</SP>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM>
        <SP>
	If <VERB>dim</VERB> is greater than then number of dimensions of A
	<VERB>R = mtlb_all(A,dim)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>R = A&lt;&gt;0</VERB> if A is not an empty matrix or by <VERB>R = A</VERB> if A is an empty matrix.
	</SP>
      </ITEM>
    </ITEMIZE>

    <P>Caution: <VERB>mtlb_all</VERB> has not to be used for hand coded functions.</P>
