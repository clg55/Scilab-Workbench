  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="mtlb_s">Matlab substraction emulation function</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>
  
  <DESCRIPTION>

    <P>Matlab and Scilab substraction behave differently in some particular cases:</P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
    <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    <ITEMIZE>
      <ITEM>
        <SP>
	With character string operands: The <VERB>-</VERB> 
	operator can not be used into Scilab with character strings, while
	Matlab realizes the substraction of the operands ASCII codes.
	</SP>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM>
        <SP>
	With empty matrix: In Scilab, if one of the
	operands is an empty matrix the result of the substraction is the
	other operand. In Matlab if one of the operand is an empty
	matrix the result of the substraction should be an error or an empty
	matrix.
	</SP>
      </ITEM>

    </DESCRIPTION_INDENT>

    <P>
    The function <VERB>mtlb_s(A,B)</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>A-B</VERB> when it was not
    possible to know what were the operands while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
    determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
    more efficient code it is possible to replace <VERB>mtlb_s</VERB> calls:
    </P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
    <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    <ITEMIZE>
      <ITEM>
        <SP>
	If <VERB>A</VERB> and <VERB>B</VERB> are character strings, 
	<VERB>mtlb_s(A,B)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>asciimat(A)-asciimat(B)</VERB>
	</SP>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM>
        <SP>
	If both <VERB>A</VERB> and <VERB>B</VERB> are not empty matrices
	<VERB>mtlb_s(A,B)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>A-B</VERB>,
	else <VERB>mtlb_s(A,B)</VERB> may be replaced by
	<VERB>[]</VERB>.
	</SP>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM>
        <SP>
	If mtlb_mode()==%T, then <VERB>mtlb_s(A,B)</VERB>
	may be replaced by <VERB>A-B</VERB> in any case where
	<VERB>A</VERB> and <VERB>B</VERB> are not character string matrices.
	</SP>
      </ITEM>
    </ITEMIZE>

    <P>Caution: <VERB>mtlb_s</VERB> has not to be used for hand coded functions.</P>
