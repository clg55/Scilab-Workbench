 ******************************************************************************
 I - TO RUN SCILAB (BINARY VERSION)
 **********************************
 
    1 - You have already installed Scilab by executing "scilab26.exe".
        By default Scilab is in "C:\Program Files\Scilab-2.6" directory.
 
    2 - Run Scilab by executing "Scilab" from the startup menu.
        In fact, it is a link to "runscilab.exe" in Scilab subdirectory "bin", 
        so you can run Scilab by executing directly "runscilab.exe".
 
    3 - Scilab has been compiled with Visual C++  (see IV below).
        All examples of incremental link given with Scilab are prepared
        for Visual C++.
 
    4 - If you have any problems or suggestions concerning Scilab,
        send an email to:
        
                           Scilab@inria.fr
 
        or better post a message to newsgroup:
 
 		      comp.soft-sys.math.scilab
 
 ******************************************************************************
 II - TO UNINSTALL SCILAB (BINARY VERSION)
 *****************************************
 
    To uninstall Scilab you can use the unintaller. You will find it in the 
    "Scilab 2.6" item of the Program Group.
    You can also use the Add/Remove Programs of the Control Panel.
 
 ******************************************************************************
 III - TO CUSTOMIZE SCILAB FONTS, WINDOW SIZE and SCILAB MENUS 
 *************************************************************
 
    When you enter Scilab for the first time the window may be too
    large and the fonts not properly choosen.  Just change this
    with mouse and menus (right mouse click in the scilab window)
    and use the "Update scilab.ini" menu to save your changes. The
    behavior is the same for graphics windows.
 	
    For the popup help, just change the size and it will keep it for 
    next calls.
 
    You can also edit the files "bin/wscilab.mnu" and
    "bin/wgscilab.mnu" to customize the Scilab menus. It's quite
    easy to change them.
 
 ******************************************************************************
 IV - TO COMPILE SCILAB FROM A SOURCE VERSION
 ********************************************
 
    We have compiled this distribution with Visual C++ 6.0. It is
    possible to compile it with egcs or Cygwin compiler but the
    incremental link does not work yet.
 
    1 - To compile with Visual C++ 4.0,  5.0 or 6.0, edit the beginning of the 
        file "Makefile.incl.mak". Then type "nmake /f Makefile.mak".
 
        If you want to compile with TCL/TK interface, you need to uncomment
        the corresponding lines in "Makefile.incl.mak". You also need to
        modify the Makefiles of TCL/TK distribution and recompile it:
        in files "tcl8.0\win\makefile.vc" and "tk8.0\win\makefile.vc" replace 
        the line
        "libcdll = msvcrt.lib oldnames.lib" by
        "libcdll = libcmt.lib oldnames.lib" and the line
        "cvarsdll   = $(cvarsmt) -D_DLL" by
        "cvarsdll   = $(cvarsmt)".
 
        If you want to compile with PVM interface, you need to uncomment
        the corresponding lines in "Makefile.incl.mak". You also need to modify
        the pathnames of the compiler in the file "conf/WIN32.def" of PVM.
        Note that at the present time, PVM interface does not work
        well on Windows.
 
    2 - To compile with egcs or Cygwin compiler, try typing "./configure" and 
        then "make all".

 VI - SOME IMPORTANT FILES AND DIRECTORIES
 *****************************************
 
 scilab.star: startup file for Scilab instructions in this file
              are executed when Scilab is executed. Note that
              you can also have your own startup file "scilab.ini" 
              in your current directory.
 
 Makefile.incl.mak: file included by all Makefile's.
 
 Version.incl: contains the scilab version. It is used by a few Makefile.
 
 Makefile.mak: the main Makefile to make Scilab.
