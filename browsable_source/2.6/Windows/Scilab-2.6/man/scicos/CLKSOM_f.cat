NAME
   CLKSOM_f - Scicos event addition block
  
DIALOGUE PARAMETERS
   None.
  
DESCRIPTION
   This block is an event addition block with up to three inputs. The output
  reproduces  the events on all the input ports. Strictly speaking, CLKSOM
  is not a Scicos block because it is discarded at the compilation phase.
  The inputs and output of CLKSOM are synchronized.
