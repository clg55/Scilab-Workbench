.SH NAME
MCLOCK_f - Scicos 2 frequency event clock
.SH DESCRIPTION
This block is a Super Block constructed by feeding back the outputs
of an MFCLCK block into its input event port. The two
outputs of this block generate regular train of events, the frequency
of the first input being equal to that of the second output divided
by an integer n. The two outputs are synchronized (this is impossible
for standard blocks; this is a Super Block).
.SH DIALOGUE PARAMETERS
.TP 15
Basic period
: scalar. equals 1/f, f being the highest frequency.
.TP
n 
: an intger >1. the frequency of the first output event is f/n.
