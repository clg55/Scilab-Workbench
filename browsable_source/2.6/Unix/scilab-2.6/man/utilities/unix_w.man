.SH DESCRIPTION
Sends a string \fVcmd\fR to Unix for execution by the sh shell. The standard 
output is redirected to scilab window.
Unix execution errors are trapped; *NOTE* that only the last shell command
error is reported when a list of command separated by ";" is sent: this is
not recommended.
