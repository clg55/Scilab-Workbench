.TP 10
sd 
: data structure build by gr_menu.

.SH DESCRIPTION
given a \fVsd\fR data structure generated by \fVgr_menu\fR
\fVsd2sci\fR forms a vector of  scilab instructions corresponding to
the graphic edited by \fVgr_menu\fR.

The optional parameters \fVsz\fR and \fVorig\fR  allows to zoom and
shift the initial graphic.

If \fVsz\fR or \fVorig\fR are given by strings generated instructions
are relative use then as formal expressions.
