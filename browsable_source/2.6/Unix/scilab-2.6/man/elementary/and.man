.SH DESCRIPTION
\fVand(A)\fR is the logical AND of elements of 
the boolean matrix \fVA\fR. \fVand(A)\fR returns \fV%T\fR ("true")  iff 
all entries of \fVA\fR are \fV%T\fR.
.LP
\fVy=and(A,'r')\fR (or, equivalently, \fVy=and(A,1)\fR) is the rowwise and. It returns in each 
entry of the row vector \fVy\fR the and of the rows of \fVx\fR (The and is performed on the 
row index : \fVy(j)= and(A(i,j),i=1,m)\fR).
.LP
\fVy=and(A,'c')\fR (or, equivalently, \fVy=and(A,2)\fR) is the columnwise and. It returns 
in each entry of the column vector \fVy\fR the and of the columns of \fVx\fR 
(The and is performed on the column index:  \fVy(i)= and(A(i,j),j=1,n)\fR)).
.LP

\fVA&B\fR  gives the element-wise logical \fVand\fR of the booleans matrices
 \fVA\fR and  \fVB\fR .\fVA\fR and  \fVB\fR must be matrices with the same
 dimensions or one from them must be a single boolean.
