	How to make calls to Scilab interpreter 
	from a Java program using JNI 
	(Java Native interface: 
		http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/jni/index.html)
	(Unix only since the proper Makefiles for windows 
	are not still writen) 
	
In this directory we provide a small example of a java class 
which use the Scilab interpreter to perform matrix computation 

This example was only tested under linux: Red Hat 7.0 linux and 
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.3.0)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.3.0, mixed mode). 

To make it run you have to edit the Makefile 
and change the SCIDIR variable to fit your local Scilab installation 

You also have to edit the file config/Makefile.all 
and change in CFLAGS the include path associated to java 
(on my local installation it was 
 -I/usr/local/jdk1.3/include -I/usr/local/jdk1.3/include/linux ) 

Then type 
	make distclean 
	javac JavaSciMatrix.java 
	make all 

	setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH `pwd`
	java JavaciMatrix 

That's all
