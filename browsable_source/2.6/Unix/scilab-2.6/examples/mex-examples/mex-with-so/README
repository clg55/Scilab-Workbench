 Libtool based mex example using shared library.
 Fill the top of the Makefile (variables FCTMEX, OTHEROBJECTS and LIBRARY)
with your own examples.
Makefile generates libmylib.c, libmylib.sce and libmylib.so 
( when LIBRARY = libmylib, default value)
CAUTION: The environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH must be defined
e.g. 
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH `pwd`  
(or: LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH for bash)  
BEFORE running Scilab. If not defined, the first parameter
of addinter (in the libmylib script) must define the complete pathname of 
the .so file.

-->exec libmylib.sce
-->pipo(1)

For Windows, fill the top of Makefile.mak AND type "make" ("make clean" to
clean).
Files generated are $(LIBRARY)_gateway.c and $(LIBRARY).sce
