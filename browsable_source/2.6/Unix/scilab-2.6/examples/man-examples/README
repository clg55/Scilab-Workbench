In this directory we show how to customize Scilab help by 
adding two new sections.

Directories "helpdir1" and "helpdir2" contain ".man" files.

By executing into Scilab the commands:

dir1="SCI/examples/man-examples/helpdir1";
dir2="SCI/examples/man-examples/helpdir2";
formatman(dir1,"ascii");
formatman(dir2,"ascii");

".man" files are processed (transformed into ".cat" files) and the
whatis files are generated. These commands are in the file
"format.sci".

Defining in Scilab an updated "%helps" variable:

%helps = [%helps; 
"./helpdir1", "Title1";
"./helpdir2", "Title2";];

allows the items in "helpdir1" and "helpdir2" to be in the Scilab
help. See the file "help.sce".  You can change your Scilab startup
(".scilab") by adding the content of this file "help.sce" in order to
get access to the new help sections.
