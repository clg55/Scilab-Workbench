  <DESCRIPTION>
  <P>
    The on line help source files are written in XML.
  </P>
  <P>
    Source files (with extension .xml) can be found in the
    <VERB>&lt;SCIDIR&gt;/man/&lt;language&gt;/*</VERB> directories. The file name is usually
    associated to a keyword (corresponding to a function name most of the cases) it describes.

  <ITEMIZE label='How to write a simple XML scilab help page'>
 
     <ITEM label='introduction'>
     <P>
     An XML file resembles to an HTML file but with both a more rigid and free syntax.
     Free because you may build your own tags : the set of tags together with its rules
     must be described somewhere, generally in another file (<VERB>&lt;SCIDIR&gt;/man/man.dtd</VERB> 
     for scilab),
     and rigid because, once the tags and rules are defined (which are called the Definition
     Type Document : DTD) , you must respect its (in particular to every open tags 
     <VERB>&lt;MY_TAG&gt;</VERB> must correspond a closed  <VERB>&lt;/MY_TAG&gt;</VERB>).
     </P>
     <P> 
     The DTD man.dtd is written in SGML and precises the exact syntax required by a 
     scilab XML help page. So if you know this language you may red this file. 
     The following annotated example (see the next sub-section) shows you some possibilities 
     offered by this DTD and may be enough to write simple help pages.
     </P>
     <P>
     Once an XML page is written and conforms to the DTD, it may be transformed in
     HTML to be red by your favorite browser or by the tcltk scilab browser
     (see section browser choice in this page). The XML -> HTML translation is controled
     by a set of rules written in the (XML) file <VERB>&lt;SCIDIR&gt;/man/language/html.xsl</VERB>.
     Those rules are currently more or less restricted to fit the tcltk scilab browser
     features (which may display correctly only basic HTML) : if you use a real HTML
     browser and want a better appearance you have to modify this file.
     </P>
     </ITEM>

     <ITEM label='An example'>
     <P>
     Here is a simple annotated XML scilab help page which describes an hypothetic foo scilab
     function. In the following, the XML file is displayed in a <TT>type writer font</TT>
     and cut-out in several parts, each part being preceded by some associated explanations.
     The entire XML file <VERB>foo.xml</VERB> is in the <VERB>&lt;SCIDIR&gt;/man/eng/utility</VERB>
     directory and the result may be displayed by clicking on <LINK>foo</LINK>.
     (you may found others examples in the <VERB>&lt;SCIDIR&gt;/examples/man-examples-xml</VERB> 
     directory). <BD>Finally</BD> note that some tag pairs <VERB>&lt;TAG&gt;</VERB>, 
     <VERB>&lt;/TAG&gt;</VERB> have been renamed here <VERB>&lt;ATAG&gt;</VERB>, 
     <VERB>&lt;/ATAG&gt;</VERB>. This is because some scilab scripts which do some work
     on or from the xml files don't verify if a tag is inside a <VERB>VERBATIM</VERB> entry.
     </P>

    <P>
      The 3 first lines of the file are mandatory, the second precises the path to the
      DTD file and the third, formed by the <VERB>&lt;MAN&gt;</VERB> tag, begin the 
      hierarchical description (the file must finish with the <VERB>&lt;/MAN&gt;</VERB> tag). 
      The 4 followings entries : <VERB>LANGUAGE</VERB>, <VERB>TITLE</VERB>, 
      <VERB>TYPE</VERB> and  <VERB>DATE</VERB>, are also mandatory (in this order) the text 
      corresponding to  <VERB>&lt;TYPE&gt;</VERB> being generally 'Scilab function' 
      (most of the cases) but may be simply  'Scilab keyword' or 'Scilab data type', ..., 
      depending of what explains the help page.have

   <P>
   The first of these 2 following entries (<VERB>SHORT_DESCRIPTION</VERB>)
   is mandatory and important since the words of the short description text, are used by the
   <LINK>apropos</LINK> command to search help pages from a keyword : the short description
   is used to build the <VERB>whatis.html</VERB> file corresponding to your toolbox and 
   the <VERB>apropos keyword</VERB> command looks in all the whatis files and then proposes
   the links to every page containing the word <VERB>keyword</VERB> in its  short description
   (in fact the actual associated tags are <VERB>&lt;SHORT_DESCRIPTION&gt;</VERB> and 
   <VERB>&lt;/SHORT_DESCRIPTION&gt;</VERB> and not <VERB>&lt;ASHORT_DESCRIPTION&gt;</VERB>
   and <VERB>&lt;/ASHORT_DESCRIPTION&gt;</VERB>).
   The next entry (<VERB>CALLING_SEQUENCE</VERB>) must be used if you describe a function 
   (but is not stricly mandatory). If your function have several calling sequences
   use several <VERB>CALLING_SEQUENCE_ITEM</VERB> entries.
   </P>

   <VERBATIM><![CDATA[
          <ASHORT_DESCRIPTION name="foo">foo short description</ASHORT_DESCRIPTION>
          <CALLING_SEQUENCE>
              <CALLING_SEQUENCE_ITEM>[y] = foo(x)</CALLING_SEQUENCE_ITEM>
          </CALLING_SEQUENCE>
   ]]></VERBATIM>

   <P>
   The following entry (<VERB>PARAM</VERB>) is not strictly mandatory but is
   the good one to describe each parameters (input and output) in case of a function.
   </P>

   <VERBATIM><![CDATA[
          <PARAM>
             <PARAM_INDENT>

   <P>
   The <VERB>DESCRIPTION</VERB> entry is perhaps the most significant one (but not strictly 
   mandatory) and may be more sophisticated than in this example (for instance you may have    
   <VERB>DESCRIPTION_ITEM</VERB> sub-entries). Here you see how to write several paragraphes
   (each one enclosed between the <VERB>&lt;P&gt;</VERB> and <VERB>&lt;/P&gt;</VERB> tags),
   how to emphasis a variable or a function name (by enclosing it between the 
   <VERB>&lt;VERB&gt;</VERB> and <VERB>&lt;/VERB&gt;</VERB> tags), how to do 
   emphasis a part of text (<VERB>EM</VERB> or <VERB>BD</VERB>
   and <VERB>TT</VERB> to put it in a type writer font)), and finally, how to put a link onto 
   another help page  (in fact the actual associated tags are <VERB>&lt;LINK&gt;</VERB> and 
   <VERB>&lt;/LINK&gt;</VERB> and not <VERB>&lt;ALINK&gt;</VERB>
   and <VERB>&lt;/ALINK&gt;</VERB>).

  <VERBATIM><![CDATA[
         <DESCRIPTION>
             <P>
                A first paragraph which explains what computes the foo function.
                If you want to emphasis a parameter name then you use the following
                tag <VERB>x</VERB>, if you want to emphasis a part of text
                <EM>inclose it inside theses tags</EM> and use theses ones
                <BD>to have a bold font</BD> and finally <TT>for a type writer style</TT>.
             </P>
             <P>
                A second paragraph... Here is an example of a link to another page :
                <ALINK>man</ALINK>.
             </P>
         </DESCRIPTION>

  <P>
  Here is how to write your own entry, for instance to describe some outside remarks
  and/or notes about your wonderful function.  
  </P>

  <VERBATIM><![CDATA[
         <ITEMIZE label='Notes'>
             <P>
                Here is a list of notes :

             <ITEM label='first'>
                  blablabla...

   ]]></VERBATIM>

  <P>
  An important entry is the <VERB>EXAMPLE</VERB> one which is reserved to show scilab
  uses of your function (begin with simple ones !). Note that you must close this entry
  with  <VERB>]]&gt;&lt;/EXAMPLE&gt;</VERB> and not like here with <VERB>}}&gt;&lt;/EXAMPLE&gt;</VERB>
  (once again this is a bad trick to avoid some interpretation problems).
  </P>
   <VERBATIM><![CDATA[
         <EXAMPLE><![CDATA[
             deff("y=foo(x)","y=x"); // define the foo function as the identity function
             foo("toto")
      }}></EXAMPLE>
   ]]></VERBATIM>

  <P>
  This last part explains how to put the links onto others related help pages 
  (as said before the good tags are in fact <VERB>&lt;LINK&gt;</VERB> and 
  <VERB>&lt;/LINK&gt;</VERB> and not <VERB>&lt;ALINK&gt;</VERB> and 
  <VERB>&lt;/ALINK&gt;</VERB> ) and finally how to reveal your name if you want 
  (use one <VERB>AUTHOR_ITEM</VERB> entry by author). Perhaps it is a good idea 
  to put an email adress if you look for bug reports !

  <ITEMIZE label='Browser choice'>
   <P>
   Scilab includes its own simple browser written in TCL/TK. On
   unix/Linux systems it is possible to choose an other one.
  </P>
  <P> The global variable <VERB>%browsehelp</VERB> contains a string defining which browser 
      must be used : its value may be changed (or redefined in your .scilab file). Note that when you 
      enter an <VERB>help</VERB> command while <VERB>%browsehelp</VERB> contains the empty matrix
      <VERB>[]</VERB> then the different 
      browser choice possibilities are displayed (so that you can enter first 
      <VERB>%browsehelp=[]</VERB> for changing of browser !). As generally different browsers 
      have differents calling sequences, if your favorite one is not in the list you have to 
      change somethings in the <VERB>&lt;SCIDIR&gt;/macros/util/help.sci</VERB> scilab function.
  </P>

  <ITEMIZE label='How to to transform your XML pages in HTML'>
