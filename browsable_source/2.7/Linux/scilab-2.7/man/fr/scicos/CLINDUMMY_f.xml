  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="CLINDUMMY_f"> Scicos dummy continuous system with state  </SHORT_DESCRIPTION>
  <DESCRIPTION>
  <P>
    This block should be placed in any block diagram that contains a
    zero-crossing block but no continuous system with state. The reason 
    for that is that it is the ode solver that find zero crossing
    surfaces.
