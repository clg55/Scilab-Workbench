  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="MFCLCK_f"> Scicos basic block for frequency division of event clock  </SHORT_DESCRIPTION>
  <DESCRIPTION>
  <P>
    This block is used in the Super Block MCLOCK. The input event is
    directed once every n times to output 1 and the rest of the time
    to output 2. There is a delay of &quot;Basic period&quot; in the transmission
    of the event. If this period &gt;0 then the second output is initially
    fired. It is not if this period=0. In the latter case, the input
    is driven by an event clock and in the former case, feedback can
    be used.
