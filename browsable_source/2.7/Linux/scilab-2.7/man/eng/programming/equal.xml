  <DESCRIPTION>
 

  <DESCRIPTION_ITEM  label='-'> 
    Equal sign is used to denote a value affectation to a variable.
  </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

  <DESCRIPTION_ITEM  label='-'> 
     <VERB> a == b</VERB>  denotes equality comparison between  expressions <VERB> a</VERB> and <VERB> b</VERB>:
  </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
 

  <DESCRIPTION_ITEM  label='With'> 
    matrix objects,
  </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
 

  <DESCRIPTION_ITEM  label='If'> 
    <VERB> a</VERB> and <VERB> b</VERB> are matrices with same types and identical dimensions, the comparison is performed element by element and the result is a matrix of booleans.
  </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

  <DESCRIPTION_ITEM  label='If'> 
    <VERB> a</VERB> and <VERB> b</VERB> are matrices with same types, but <VERB> a</VERB> or <VERB> b</VERB> is a 1 by 1 matrix the scalar is compared with each element of the matrix. The result is a matrix of booleans. 
  </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

  <DESCRIPTION_ITEM  label='In'> 
    The others cases the result is the boolean <VERB> %f</VERB> 
  </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
 

  <DESCRIPTION_ITEM  label='With'> 
    list objects,
  </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
 

  <DESCRIPTION_ITEM  label='If'> 
    <VERB> a</VERB> and <VERB> b</VERB> are lists with  identical sizes, the comparison is performed element by element and and recursively. The result is a row vector of booleans.
  </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

  <DESCRIPTION_ITEM  label='If'> 
    <VERB> a</VERB> and <VERB> b</VERB> are lists with non equal sizes the result is the boolean <VERB> %f</VERB>.
  </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
 

  <DESCRIPTION_ITEM  label='With'> 
    tlist and mlist object. If no overloading function is defined the <VERB> list</VERB> comparison method is used.
  </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

  <DESCRIPTION_ITEM  label='With'> 
    other data types (functions, libraries,...) , the result is <VERB> %t</VERB> if the objects are identical and <VERB> %f</VERB> in the other case.
  </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
 
  <P>
    Comparison between different data types returns <VERB> %f</VERB>.
