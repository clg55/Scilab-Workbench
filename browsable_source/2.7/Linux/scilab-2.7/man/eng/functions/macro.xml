  <DESCRIPTION>
  <P>
    Macros are Scilab procedures (&quot;macro&quot;, &quot;function&quot; and &quot;procedure&quot;
    have the save meaning). Usually, they are defined 
    in files with an editor and loaded into Scilab by <VERB>getf</VERB> or through
    a library. 
  </P>
  <P>
    They can also be defined on-line (see <VERB>deff</VERB>). 
    A file which contains a macro must begin as follows:
  </P>
  <VERBATIM><![CDATA[
function [y1,...,yn]=foo(x1,...,xm)
   ]]></VERBATIM>
  <P>
    The <VERB>yi</VERB> are output variables calculated as functions of
    input variables and variables existing in Scilab
    when the macro is executed.
    A macro can be compiled for faster execution. Collections
    of macros can be collected in libraries.
    Macros which begin with <VERB>%</VERB> sign (e.g. <VERB>%foo</VERB>) and whose
    arguments are lists are used to perform specific 
    operations: for example, <VERB>z=%rmr(x,y)</VERB> is equivalent
    to <VERB>z=x*y</VERB> when <VERB>x</VERB> and <VERB>z</VERB> are rationals 
    (i.e. <VERB>x=list(&apos;r&apos;,n,d,[])</VERB> with <VERB>n</VERB> and <VERB>d</VERB> polynomials).
