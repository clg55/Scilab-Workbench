  <DESCRIPTION>
  <P>
    A library is a data type with type number 14. It contains a path-name
    and a set of names. It allows automatic loading of variables using the
    following algorithm:
  </P>
  <P>
    Suppose the Scilab user references the variable named <VERB>foo</VERB>.
    Scilab first looks if <VERB>foo</VERB> is the name of a primitive or of an
    already defined variable. If not, it looks for <VERB>foo</VERB> sequentially
    (the newest first) in all defined library .
  </P>
  <P>
    Suppose <VERB>foo</VERB> belongs to the set of names of the library <VERB>xlib</VERB>
    then Scilab tries to load the file
    &lt;xlib-path-name&gt;/foo.bin. &lt;xlib-path-name&gt;/foo.bin must have been
    created using the <VERB>save</VERB> function
  </P>
  <P>
    Library are often used for collection of functions, but they can also
    be used for any collection of scilab variables
  </P>
  <P>
    If a function is defined in more than one library, the default search
    algorithm loads thode contained in the newest. It possible to force
    the use of a specific library using dot notation:
  </P>
  <P>
    <VERB>xlib.foo</VERB> loads the variable <VERB>foo</VERB> contained in <VERB>xlib</VERB>.
    if <VERB>foo</VERB> is a function 
    and <VERB>xlib.foo(args)</VERB> executes the functions
  </P>
  <P>
  </P>

  <EXAMPLE><![CDATA[
// elemlib is a predefined library
elemlib //displays the contents of the library
A=rand(3,3);
cosm(A) //loads cosm and executes it

who // now cosm is a variable

elemlib.sinm //loads sinm from the library

elemlib.cosm(A) //reloads cosm and executes it
