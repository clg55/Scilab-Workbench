This directory contains evaluation programs for testing Scilab's
installation on your machine.

1- To run a global test on various functions, execute "maketests.sce"
   into Scilab in this directory. On Unix systems, you can execute 
   "make tests".
   Results of the tests are compared to corresponding references. Failure 
   of a test does not necessarily imply bad installation. Failure may be 
   due to small differences in machine constants. This can happen in 
   particular in "matopt.tst".

2- to run test on a specific item, invoke Scilab in this directory
   and  type "exec('<item>.tst')" at Scilab prompt.
   or type 
	make <name>.dia to run test on name 
	ex : rm calelm.dia 
	make calelm.dia
