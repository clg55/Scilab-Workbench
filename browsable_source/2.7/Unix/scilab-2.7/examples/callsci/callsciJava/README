	How to make calls to Scilab interpreter 
	from a Java program using JNI 
	(Java Native interface: 
		http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/jni/index.html)
	(Unix only since the proper Makefiles for windows 
	are not still writen) 

	
In this directory we provide a small example of a java class 
which use the Scilab interpreter to perform matrix computation 

This example was only tested under linux: Red Hat 7.0 linux and 
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.3.0)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.3.0, mixed mode). 

Important Note: This demo will not work with a binary scilab 
	version. You need to have a locally compiled scilab version 
	(I need some .o files) 

To make it run you have to edit the Makefile 
and change the SCIDIR variable to fit your local Scilab installation 

You also have to edit the file config/Makefile.all 
and change in CFLAGS the include path associated to java 
(on my local installation it was 
 -I/usr/local/jdk1.3/include -I/usr/local/jdk1.3/include/linux ) 

Also edit javasci/Makefile to fit your local java 
compilation rules. 

Then type 
	make distclean 
	make all 
	setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH `pwd`

	and run the test files 

	java TestMatrix1 
	java TestMatrix2
	java TestMatrix3
	java TestMatrix4 

That's all
