  <DESCRIPTION>
  The figure entity is the top level of the graphics entities
  hierarchy. This entity contain a number of properties designed to control 
  many aspects of displaying Scilab graphics objects.
  These properties fall into two categories. Properties that contain information 
  about figure itself and others related to set default values for the children creation.


  <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label='Figure properties: '>
  <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label='figure_style: '>
     The value of this field difines the figure style, it
      should be <VERB>"old"</VERB> or <VERB>"new"</VERB>.  The
      <VERB>"new"</VERB> value sets the entity based style. The
      <VERB>"old"</VERB> value represents the old Scilab graphic mode. In
      this case <VERB>figure_style</VERB> is the only defined property.
     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label='figure_position: '>
     This field contains the position in pixel of the  graphic
     window  on the screen. The size is the vector 
     <VERB>[x,y]</VERB>. The point <VERB>[0,0]</VERB> if the
     upper-left corner of the screen.
     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label='figure_size: '>
     This property controls the size in pixel of the screen's graphics
     window. The size is the vector <VERB>[width,height] </VERB>.
     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    
     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label='axes_size: '>
     Used to Specifies  the size in pixel of the virtual graphics
     window. The size is the vector <VERB>[width,height] </VERB>.
     The  virtual graphic window should be bigger than the part really
     visible on the screen.
     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label='auto_resize: '>
     This property determines if graphics window is resized.
     If the value is <VERB>"on"</VERB> then the <VERB>axes_size</VERB> 
     property is equaled to the <VERB>figure_size</VERB> and the axes 
     children are zoomed accordingly. If the value is <VERB>"off"</VERB> that indicate 
     that <VERB>axes_size</VERB> cannot be resized when <VERB>figure_size</VERB>
     is changed.
     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label='figure_name: '>
     This field contains the name of the figure. This name  is a
     character string displayed at the top of the graphics_window.
     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label='figure_id: '>
     This field contains the identifier of the figure. This  is a
     integer number which is prefexed to the figure_window, set at 
     figure creation and cannot be changed after .
     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label='color_map: '>
     Property which defines the colormap used by this figure. The
     colormap is a <VERB>m</VERB> by <VERB>3</VERB> matrix.
     <VERB>m</VERB> is the number of colors. Color number i is given
     as a 3-uple <VERB>R</VERB>, <VERB>G</VERB>, <VERB>B</VERB> corresponding
     respectively to red, green and blue intensity between 0 and 1
     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label='background: '>
     This property controls the figure window background color. IT takes as value
     an index relative to the current colormap. 
     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

  
     <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label='pixel_drawing_mode: '>
     This field defines the bitwise operation used to draw the pixel
     on the screen. The default mode is <VERB>copy</VERB> what is to
     say the pixel is drawn as required. More generally the bitwise
     operation is performed between the color of the source pixel and
     the color of the pixel already present on the screen. 
     operations are :    
    <VERB>"clear"</VERB>, 
    <VERB>"and"</VERB>, 
    <VERB>"andReverse"</VERB> , 
    <VERB>"copy"</VERB>,  src

    <VERB>"orReverse"</VERB> , 
    <VERB>"copyInverted"</VERB> , 
    <VERB>"orInverted"</VERB> , 
    <VERB>"nand"</VERB> , 
    <VERB>"set"</VERB> , 

     </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
