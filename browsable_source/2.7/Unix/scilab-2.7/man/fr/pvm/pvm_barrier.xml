  <DESCRIPTION>
  <P>
    <VERB>pvm_barrier</VERB> blocks the calling process until <VERB>count</VERB>
    members of the <VERB>group</VERB> have called pvm_barrier.
    The count argument is required because processes could be
    joining the given group after other processes have called
    pvm_barrier. Thus PVM doesn&apos;t know how many group members
    to wait for at any given instant. Although count can be set less,
    it is typically the total number of members of the group.
    So the logical function of the pvm_barrier call
    is to provide a group synchronization.
    During any given barrier call all participating group members
    must call barrier with the same count value.
    Once a given barrier has been successfully passed,
    pvm_barrier can be called again by the same group using the same
    group name.
  </P>
  <P>
    If pvm_barrier is successful,
  </P>
  <P>
    will be 0. If some error occurs then
  </P>
  <P>
    will be &lt; 0.
