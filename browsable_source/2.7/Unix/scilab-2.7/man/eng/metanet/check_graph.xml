  <DESCRIPTION>
  <P>
    <VERB>check_graph</VERB> checks its argument <VERB>g</VERB> to see if it is a
    graph list. The checking is not only syntactic (number of elements of the
    list, compatible sizes of the vectors), but also semantic in the sense that 
    <VERB>check_graph</VERB> checks that <VERB>node_number</VERB>, <VERB>tail</VERB> and
    <VERB>head</VERB> elements of the list can really represent a graph.
  </P>
  <P>
    Moreover, the names of the node must be different. In fact, this
    do not give errors in Scilab, but strange behaviour can appear when using the 
    Metanet window. So, this is not checked by <VERB>check_graph</VERB> 
    because it is time consuming. It is only checked when loading, saving
    or showing a graph.
