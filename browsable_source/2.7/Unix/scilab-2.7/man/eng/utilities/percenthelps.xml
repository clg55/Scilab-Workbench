  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="%helps"> Variable defining the path of help directories  </SHORT_DESCRIPTION>
  <DESCRIPTION>
  <P>
    The global variable <VERB>%helps</VERB> is an N x 2 matrix of strings. 
    The kth row of <VERB>%helps</VERB>, <VERB>%helps(k,:)</VERB> represents
    the kth chapter of the manual and is made of two strings:
  </P>
  <P>
    <VERB>%helps(k,1)</VERB> is the absolute pathname for a help directory.
  </P>
  <P>
    <VERB>%helps(k,2)</VERB> is a title for this help directory.
    For instance, for k=2, we have the graphics chapter 
    <VERB>%helps(2,:)</VERB>.
  </P>
  <P>
    The variable <VERB>%helps</VERB> is defined in the Scilab startup
    file <VERB>SCI+&quot;/scilab.star&quot;</VERB>.
  </P>
  <P>
    To add a new help directory, the user should add a row to
    the variable <VERB>%helps</VERB>. (One row for each directory).
  </P>
  <P>
    For instance, <VERB>%helps=[%helps; &quot;Path-Of-My-Help-Dir&quot;,&quot;My-Title&quot;];</VERB>
    enables the Scilab help browser to look for help manual items
    in the directory with pathname &quot;Path-Of-My-Help-Dir&quot;.
  </P>
  <P>
    &quot;My-Title&quot; is then the title of a new help chapter.
  </P>
  <P>
    A valid help directory must contain:
  </P>
  <P>
    1- A set of <VERB>.html</VERB> files (e.g. <VERB>item1.html, item2.html</VERB> etc).
    The <VERB>.html</VERB> files are usually built from XML files.
  </P>
  <P>
    2- A <VERB>whatis.html</VERB> file, which must have a special format. Each row
    of the <VERB>whatis</VERB> must be as follows:
  </P>
  <VERBATIM><![CDATA[
<BR><A HREF="item.html">item</A> - quick description
   ]]></VERBATIM>
  <P>
    <VERB>item</VERB> is the item of the help, i.e. the command <VERB>help item</VERB>
    displays the contents of the file <VERB>item.html</VERB>.
  </P>
  <P>
  </P>
  <P>
    The command <VERB>apropos keyword</VERB> returns the row(s) of all
    the <VERB>whatis.html</VERB> file(s) in which the keyword appears.
  </P>
  <P>
  </P>
  <P>
    On Linux platforms Scilab provides a Makefile for transforming
    <VERB>.xml</VERB> pages into <VERB>.html</VERB> pages (see SCIDIR/examples/man-examples).
