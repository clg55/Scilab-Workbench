  <DESCRIPTION>
  <P>
    This function computes   the frequency of values of  the
    components of a  numerical o chain  of characters vector
    or matrix <VERB>x</VERB>.
  </P>
  <P>
    If <VERB>x</VERB> is a numerical vector or matrix, <VERB>m</VERB> is a
    two column matrix who  contains in the first column  the
    values of <VERB>x</VERB> sorted in descending  order and in the
    other  column there is the number  of occurrences of the
    corresponding value in <VERB>x</VERB>.
  </P>
  <P>
    If <VERB>x</VERB> is composed of  chains of characters, <VERB>m</VERB>
    is a list whose first member is a string vector composed
    with the  values of <VERB>x</VERB> and  the second  member is a
    vector whose components are the number of occurrences of
    each value in <VERB>x</VERB>.
  </P>
