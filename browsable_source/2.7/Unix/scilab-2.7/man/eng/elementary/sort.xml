  <DESCRIPTION>
  <P>
    <VERB>s=sort(v)</VERB> sorts <VERB>v</VERB>  in decreasing order. 
    If <VERB>v</VERB> is a matrix, sorting
    is done columnwise, <VERB>v</VERB> being seen as the stacked vector <VERB>v(:)</VERB>.
    <VERB>[s,k]=sort(v)</VERB> gives in addition the indices of entries 
    of <VERB>s</VERB> in <VERB>v</VERB>, i.e. <VERB>v(k(:)) </VERB> is the vector <VERB>s</VERB>.
  </P>
  <P>
    <VERB>s=sort(v,&apos;r&apos;)</VERB> sorts the rows of <VERB>v</VERB> in decreasing order i.e.
    each column of <VERB>s</VERB> is obtained from each column of <VERB>v</VERB>
    by reordering it in decreasing order.
    <VERB>[s,k]=sort(v,&apos;r&apos;)</VERB> returns in addition in each column of <VERB>k</VERB>
    the indices such that <VERB>v(k(:,i),i)=s(:,i)</VERB> for each column index <VERB>i</VERB>.
  </P>
  <P>
    <VERB>s=sort(v,&apos;c&apos;)</VERB> sorts the columns of <VERB>v</VERB> in decreasing order i.e.
    each row of <VERB>s</VERB> is obtained from each row of <VERB>v</VERB>
    by reordering it in decreasing order.
    <VERB>[s,k]=sort(v,&apos;c&apos;)</VERB> returns in addition in each row of <VERB>k</VERB>
    the indices such that <VERB>v(i,k(i,:))=s(i,:)</VERB> for each row index <VERB>i</VERB>.
  </P>
  <P>
    Complex matrices or vectors are sorted w.r.t their magnitude.
  </P>
  <P>
    <VERB>y=sort(A)</VERB> is valid when <VERB>A</VERB> is a sparse vector. Column/row
    sorting is not implemented for sparse matrices.
  </P>

  <EXAMPLE><![CDATA[
[s,p]=sort(rand(1,10));
//p  is a random permutation of 1:10
A=[1,2,5;3,4,2];
[Asorted,q]=sort(A);A(q(:))-Asorted(:)
v=1:10;
sort(v)
sort(v')
