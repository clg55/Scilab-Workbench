  <DESCRIPTION>
  <P>
    <VERB>and(A)</VERB> is the logical AND of elements of 
    the boolean matrix <VERB>A</VERB>. <VERB>and(A)</VERB> returns <VERB>%T</VERB> (&quot;true&quot;)  iff 
    all entries of <VERB>A</VERB> are <VERB>%T</VERB>.
  </P>
  <P>
    <VERB>y=and(A,&apos;r&apos;)</VERB> (or, equivalently, <VERB>y=and(A,1)</VERB>) is the rowwise and. It returns in each 
    entry of the row vector <VERB>y</VERB> the and of the rows of <VERB>x</VERB> (The and is performed on the 
    row index : <VERB>y(j)= and(A(i,j),i=1,m)</VERB>).
  </P>
  <P>
    <VERB>y=and(A,&apos;c&apos;)</VERB> (or, equivalently, <VERB>y=and(A,2)</VERB>) is the columnwise and. It returns 
    in each entry of the column vector <VERB>y</VERB> the and of the columns of <VERB>x</VERB> 
    (The and is performed on the column index:  <VERB>y(i)= and(A(i,j),j=1,n)</VERB>)).
  </P>
  <P>
  </P>
  <P>
    <VERB>A&amp;B</VERB>  gives the element-wise logical <VERB>and</VERB> of the booleans matrices
     <VERB>A</VERB> and  <VERB>B</VERB> .<VERB>A</VERB> and  <VERB>B</VERB> must be matrices with the same
     dimensions or one from them must be a single boolean.
