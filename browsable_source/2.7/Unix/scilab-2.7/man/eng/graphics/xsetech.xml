  <DESCRIPTION>
  <P>
    <VERB>xsetech</VERB> is mainly used to set the sub-window of the graphics
    window which will be used for plotting. The sub-window is specified
    with the parameter <VERB>wrect=[x,y,w,h]</VERB> (upper-left point, width,
    height).  The values in <VERB>wrect</VERB> are specified using proportion of
    the width or height of the current graphic window. For instance
    <VERB>wrect=[0,0,1,1]</VERB> means that the whole graphics window will be
    used, and <VERB>wrect=[0.5,0,0.5,1]</VERB> means that the graphics region
    will be the right half of the graphics window.
  </P>
  <P>
    <VERB>xsetech</VERB> also set the current graphics scales for 2D plotting and
    can be used in conjunction with graphics routines which request the
    current graphics scale (for instance <VERB>strf=&quot;x0z&quot;</VERB>
    or<VERB>frameflag=0</VERB> in <VERB>plot2d</VERB>).
  </P>
  <P>
    <VERB>frect=[xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax]</VERB> is used to set the graphics scale
    and is just like the <VERB>rect</VERB> argument of <VERB>plot2d</VERB>. If
    <VERB>frect</VERB> is not given the current value of the graphic scale
    remains unchanged. the default value of <VERB>rect</VERB> is <VERB>[0,0,1,1]</VERB>
    (at window creation, when switching back to default value with
    <VERB>xset(&apos;default&apos;)</VERB> or when clearing graphic recorded events
    <VERB>xbasc()</VERB>).
  </P>
  <P>
    <VERB>arect=[x_left, x_right,y_up,y_down]</VERB> is used to set the graphic
    frame inside the subwindow. The graphic frame is specified (like
    <VERB>wrect</VERB>) using proportion of the width or height of the current
    graphic subwindow.  Default value is <VERB>1/8*[1,1,1,1]</VERB>. If
    <VERB>arect</VERB> is not given, current value remains unchanged.

// To get a graphical explanation of xsetech parameters enter:
exec('SCI/demos/graphics/xsetechfig.sce');


// Here xsetech is used to split the graphics window in two parts 
// first xsetech is used to set the first sub-window 
// and the graphics scale 
xsetech([0,0,1.0,0.5],[-5,-3,5,3])
// we call plot2d with the "001" option to use the graphics scale 
// set by xsetech 
plot2d([1:10]',[1:10]',1,"001"," ")
// then xsetech is used to set the second sub-window 
xsetech([0,0.5,1.0,0.5])
// the graphics scale is set by xsetech to [0,0,1,1] by default 
// and we change it with the use of the rect argument in plot2d 
plot2d([1:10]',[1:10]',1,"011"," ",[-6,-6,6,6])
// Four plots on a single graphics window 
xbasc()

xsetech([0,0.5,0.5,0.5]); histplot()
// back to default values for the sub-window 
xsetech([0,0,1,1])
// One plot with changed arect
