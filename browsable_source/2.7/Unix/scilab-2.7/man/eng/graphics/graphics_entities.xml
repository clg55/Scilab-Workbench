  graphics entities data structures </SHORT_DESCRIPTION>
 
  <DESCRIPTION>
  Scilab graphics is based on two differents modes. In the <VERB>"old"</VERB> 
  mode, the graphics functions are stored to enable redisplay, zoom and
  rotations. Comparrement at the <VERB>"new"</VERB> mode, each graphics 
  window and the drawing it contains are represented by hierchical entities. 
  The hierachy to level is the Figure. Each Figure defines at least one
  children of type Axes. Each Axes entity contains a set of leaf
  entities which are the basic graphics objects like Polylines,
  Rectangles, Arcs, Segs,... It can also contain an Agregation type 
  which are recursive sets of entities. The main interest of the new
  graphic mode is to make property change easier. This new graphics'mode
  provides a set of high-level graphing routines 
  (see <LINK>set</LINK>,  <LINK>get</LINK>) used to control objects' properties
  such us data, coordinates and scaling, color and appearences without requiring 
  to replay the initial graphics commands. 
  <P></P>
  Graphics entities are associated to Scilab variables of type
  <VERB>handle</VERB>. The handle is a unique identifier which is associated
  to each instance of a created graphical entity. Using this handle, 
  it will be possible to reach entities' properties through "set" and "get" routines.
  The handles are also used to manipulate graphics objects, to move them, 
  to make copies or delete them.
  <P></P>
  To set the current graphics window mode we can use these following instructions: 
  <VERB>set("figure_style","new") </VERB> to have a graphics window under the "new" mode or  
  <VERB>set("figure_style","old ")</VERB> for the "old" mode. 
  <P></P>
  The instructions
  <VERB>set("old_style","off")</VERB> and
  <VERB>set("old_style","on")</VERB> are used to set the
  default mode to be used when a new graphics window is created. 
  <P></P>
  The new graphics mode is a beta version. So the "old" mode is set as
  default.

  <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label='Figure: '>
   The figure entity is the top level of the graphics entities
  hierarchy. This entity defines the parameters for the figure itself
  as well as the parameters' default values for the children
  creation. The figure children are the Axes entities. 
  <P></P>
  See <LINK>figure_properties</LINK> for details.
  <P></P>
  The handle on the current figure may be got using <VERB>get("current_figure")</VERB>.

  </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
  <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label='Axes'>
  The Axes entity is the second level of the graphics entities
  hierarchy. This entity defines the parameters for the change of
  coordinates and the axes drawing
  as well as the  parameters' default values for the children creation. 
  <P></P>
 See <LINK>axes_properties</LINK> for details.
 <P></P>
  The handle on the current Axes may be got using <VERB>get("current_axes")</VERB>.
  </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

  <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label='Agregation'>
 The agregation entity is just a vector of children and with a single
