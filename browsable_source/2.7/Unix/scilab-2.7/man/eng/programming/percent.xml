  <DESCRIPTION>
  <P>
    Some predefined variables names begin with <VERB>%</VERB>, such as
    <VERB>%i</VERB> (for <VERB>sqrt(-1)</VERB>), <VERB>%inf</VERB> (for <VERB>Infinity</VERB>), <VERB>%pi</VERB> (for <VERB>3.14...</VERB>),
    <VERB>%T</VERB> (for the boolean constant <VERB>&quot;true&quot;</VERB>),...
  </P>
  <P>
    In addition, functions whose names begin with <VERB>%</VERB> are special : 
    they are used for primitives and operators overloading (see <VERB>overloading</VERB>).
  </P>
  <P>
    For example the function <VERB>%rmr</VERB> performs the multiplication (<VERB>m</VERB>)
    operation <VERB>x*y</VERB> for <VERB>x</VERB> and <VERB>y</VERB> rational matrices (<VERB>r</VERB>).
    The coding conventions are given by the readme file in 
    directory <VERB>SCIDIR/macros/percent</VERB>.
  </P>
