  <DESCRIPTION>
  <P>
    Backslash denotes left matrix division. 
    <VERB>x=A\b</VERB> is a solution to <VERB>A*x=b</VERB>.
  </P>
  <P>
    If <VERB>A</VERB> is square and nonsingular <VERB>x=A\b</VERB> (uniquely defined) 
    is equivalent to <VERB>x=inv(A)*b</VERB> (but the computations are much cheaper).
  </P>
  <P>
    If <VERB>A</VERB> is not square, <VERB>x</VERB> is a least square solution.
    i.e. <VERB>norm(A*x-b)</VERB> is minimal (euclidian norm). If <VERB>A</VERB> is full
    column rank, the least square solution, <VERB>x=A\b</VERB>, is uniquely 
    defined (there is a unique <VERB>x</VERB> which minimizes <VERB>norm(A*x-b)</VERB>).
    If <VERB>A</VERB> is not full column rank, then the least square
    solution is not unique, and <VERB>x=A\b</VERB>, in general, is not the solution
    with minimum norm (the minimum norm solution is <VERB>x=pinv(A)*b</VERB>). 
  </P>
  <P>
    <VERB>A.\B</VERB>  is the matrix with <VERB>(i,j)</VERB> entry <VERB>A(i,j)\B(i,j)</VERB>.
    If <VERB>A</VERB> (or <VERB>B</VERB>) is a scalar <VERB>A.\B</VERB> is equivalent to 
    <VERB>A*ones(B).\B</VERB> (or <VERB>A.\(B*ones(A))</VERB>
  </P>
  <P>
  </P>
  <P>
    <VERB>A\.B</VERB>  is an operator with no predefined meaning. It may be used
    to define a new operator (see overloading) with  the same precedence as * or /.
  </P>
