This directory contains the Maple to Scilab interface. 
It allows to transfer of Maple objects into Scilab functions, via C,
via Fortran or directly in Scilab code.

"maple2scilab.mpl" is the Maple code to load into Maple

"examples.mpl" gives Maple examples of the use of "maple2scilab" procedure.
"examples.tst" shows how to load into Scilab the files generated by
               "examples.tst"

Doing "make test" executes the previous examples. The Maple output is in
the file "examples.out" and the Scilab output is in "examples.dia".
"examples.dia" must be the same as "examples.dia.ref" after execution.
Perhaps you need to change the path of Maple program at the beginning of the
"Makefile".
