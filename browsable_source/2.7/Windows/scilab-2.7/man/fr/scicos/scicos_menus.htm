  </li>
 

  <li><b>Palettes</b> 
    : opens up a selection dialog where user may select a desired palette among all defined palettes.
  </li>

  <li><b>Context</b> 
    : opens up a dialog where user may enter and modify Scilab instructions to be executed  when diagram is loaded (<tt><b>Edit../Load</b></tt> menu) or evaluated (<tt><b>Simulate../Eval</b></tt> menu) (of course instructions are also evaluated when dialog returns).These instructions may be used to define Scilab variables whose names are used in the block parameters definition expressions.
  </li>

  <li><b>Move</b> 
    : To move a block in main Scicos window, select first the Move menu item, then click on the selected block, drag the mouse to the desired block position and click again to fix the position.
  </li>

  <li><b>Copy :</b> 
    To copy a block in main Scicos window, select first the Copy menu item, then click left on the to-be-copied block (in Scicos window or in a palette) , and finally click where you want the copy to be placed in Scicos window. This menu item remains active until user choose an other one
  </li>

  <li><b>Copy Region:</b> 
    To copy a region in main Scicos window, select first the Copy menu item, then click right on a corner of the desired region (in Scicos window or in a palette) , drag to select the desired region, click to fix the selected region and finally click where you want the copy to be placed in Scicos window.

  </li>

  <li><b>Replace :</b> 
    To replace a block in the active editor Scicos window select first the Replace menu item, then select the replacement block (in Scicos window or in a palette) ,  and finally click on the to-be-replaced block. It is not possible to replace a connected block with another block with different port locations. 
  </li>

  <li><b>Align</b> 
    : To obtain nice diagrams, you can align ports of different blocks, vertically and horizontally.  select first the Align menu item, then on the first port and finally on the second port.  The block corresponding to the second port is moved. Connected blocks cannot be aligned.
  </li>

  <li><b>AddNew</b> 
    :To add a newly defined block to the current palette or diagram select first this menu item, a dialog box will pop up asking for the name of the GUI function associated with the block. If this function is not already loaded it is searched in the current directory. The user may then click at the desired position of the block in the palette or diagram .
  </li>

  <li><b>Link</b> 
    : This menu item is defined only in diagram edition mode.  To connect an output port to an input port, select first the Link menu item, then on the intermediate points, if necessary, and finally on the input port. Scicos tries to draw horizontal and vertical lines to form links.  To split a link, select first the Link menu item, then on the link where the split should be placed, and finally on an input port.  Only one link can go from and to a port.  Link color can be changed directly by clicking on the link.  This menu item remains active until user choose an other one

  </li>

  <li><b>Delete Region</b> 
    :To delete a region in main Scicos window select first the Delete Region menu item, then click right on a corner of the desired region (in Scicos window or in a palette), drag to select de desired region, click to fix the selected region. If source diagram is a big region, selection may take a while. 
  </li>

  <li><b>Flip</b> 
    : To reverse the positions of the (regular) inputs and outputs of a block placed on its sides, click on the Flip menu item first and then on the selected block. This does not affect the order, nor the position of the input and output event ports which are numbered from left to right. A connected block cannot be flipped.
  </li>

  <li><b>Undo</b> 
    : Click on the Undo menu item to undo the last edit operation. 
  </li>
 

  <li><b>Simulation menu</b> 
    : 
  </li>
 

  <li><b>Setup</b> 
    : In the main Scicos window, clicking on the Setup menu item invokes a dialog box that allows you to change integration parameters: absolute and relative error tolerances for the ode solver, the time tolerance (the smallest time interval for which the ode solver is used to update continuous states), and the maximum time increase realized by a single call to the ode solver. 
  </li>

  <li><b>Compile</b> 
    : This menu item need never be used since compilation is performed automatically, if necessary, before the beginning of every simulation (<tt><b>Run</b></tt> menu item).    Normally, a new compilation is not needed if only system parameters and internal states are modified.  In some cases however modifications are not correctly updated and a manual compilation may be needed before a Restart or a Continue. Click on this menu item to compile the block diagram.  Please report if you encounter such a case.
  </li>

  <li><b>Eval</b> 
    : blocks dialogs answers can be defined using  Scilab expressions. These expressions  are evaluated immediately and they are also stored as character strings. Click on the Eval menu item to have them re-evaluated according to the new values of underlying Scilab variables defined by context for example.
  </li>

  <li><b>Run</b> 
    : To start the simulation.  If the system has already been simulated, a dialog box appears where you can choose to Continue, Restart or End the simulation. You may interrupt the simulation by clicking on the "stop" button, change any of the block parameters and continue or restart the simulation with the new values.
  </li>
 

  <li><b>Diagram menu</b> 
    : 
  </li>

A dialog allows choosing the directory. This block may be added  to a palette using <tt><b>Edit/AddNew</b></tt> menu item.
  </li>

  <li><b>Save</b> 
    : Saves the block diagram in the current binary file selected by a previous call to <tt><b>SaveAs</b></tt> or <tt><b>Load</b></tt> menu item. If no current binary file, diagram is saved in the current directory as <tt><b>&lt;window_name&gt;.cos</b></tt>.

  <li><b>Save As</b> 
    : Saves the block diagram in a binary file. A file selection dialog will pop up.
  </li>

  <li><b>FSave</b> 
    : Save the diagram in a formatted ascii file. A dialog box allows choosing the file name which must have a .cosf extension.     Formatted save is slower than regular save but has the advantage that the generated file is system independent (usefull for exchanging data on different computers.      
  </li>

  <li><b>Load :</b> 
    Loads an ascii or binary file containing a saved block diagram. A file selection dialog will pop up.
  </li>

  <li><b>Save as Palette</b> 
    : select the Save as Palette menu item to save the block diagram as a palette in a binary file. A dialog box allows choosing  the file which must have a .cos extension. The palette takes the name of the file (without the extension).  <tt><b>.scilab</b></tt> user file is updated.
  </li>

  <li><b>FSave as Palette</b>
