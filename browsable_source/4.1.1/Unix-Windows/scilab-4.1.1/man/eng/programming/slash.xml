  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="slash"> (/) right division and feed back</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>
  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>
    Right division.  <VERB>x=A / b</VERB> is the solution of <VERB>x*b=A</VERB> .</P>
    <P><VERB>b/a = (a' \ b')'</VERB> .</P>
    <P><VERB>a ./  b</VERB> is the matrix with entries <VERB>a(i,j)/ b(i,j)</VERB>.
    If <VERB>b</VERB> is scalar (1x1 matrix) this operation is the same
    as <VERB> a./b*ones(a)</VERB>. (Same convention if <VERB>a</VERB> is a scalar).</P>
    <P>
    Remark that <VERB>123./b</VERB> is interpreted as <VERB>(123.)/b</VERB>. In this
    cases dot is part of the  number not of the operator.</P>
    <P>
    Backslash stands for left division.</P>
    <P>
    System feed back.  <VERB>S=G/.K</VERB> evaluates <VERB>S=G*(eye()+K*G)^(-1)</VERB>
    this operator avoid simplification problem.</P>
    <P>
    Remark that <VERB>G/.5</VERB> is interpreted as <VERB>G/(.5)</VERB>. In such 
    cases dot is part of the number, not of the operator.</P>
    <P>
    Comment <VERB>//</VERB> comments a line i.e lines which begin by <VERB>//</VERB> are
    ignored by the interpreter.</P>
