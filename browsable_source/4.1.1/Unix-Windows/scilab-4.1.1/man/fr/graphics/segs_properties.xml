  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="segs_properties">description of the Segments entity
  properties</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>The Segs entity is a leaf of the graphics entities hierarchy. This
    entity defines the parameters for a set of colored segments or colored
    arrows.</P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="parent: ">
        <SP>This property contains the handle of the parent. The parent of the
        segment entity should be of the type <VERB>"Axes"</VERB> or
        <VERB>"Compound"</VERB>.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="children: ">
        <SP>This property contains a vector with the <VERB>children</VERB> of
        the handle. However, <VERB>segs</VERB> handles currently do not have
        any <VERB>children</VERB>.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="visible: ">
        <SP>This field contains the <VERB>visible</VERB> property value for
        the entity . It should be <VERB>"on" </VERB> or <VERB>"off"</VERB> .
        By default, the segments are visibles, the value's property is
        <VERB>"on"</VERB>. If <VERB>"off"</VERB> the segments are not drawn on
        the screen.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="data: ">
        <SP>This field is two column matrix <VERB>[x,y,[z]]</VERB> which gives
        the coordinates of the segments boundary. If
        <VERB>xv=matrix(x,2,-1)</VERB> and <VERB>yv=matrix(y,2,-1)</VERB> then
        <VERB>xv(:,k)</VERB> and <VERB>yv(:,k)</VERB> are the boundary
        coordinates of the segment numbered <VERB>k</VERB>.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="line_mode: ">
        <SP>This field contains the default <VERB>line_mode</VERB> property
        value for the segs. Its value should be <VERB>"on" </VERB>(line drawn)
        or <VERB>"off"</VERB> (no line drawn).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="line_style: ">
        <SP>The <VERB>line_style</VERB> property value should be an integer in
        [0 6]. 0 stands for solid the other value stands for a selection of
        dashes. This property applies to all segments.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="thickness: ">
        <SP>This field contains the <VERB>thickness</VERB> property for all
        segments. Its value should be a non negative integer..</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="arrow_size: ">
        <SP>Factor that specify the size of a arrowheads. With a negative
        value, the size is also dependent of the arrows length. TO draw
        segment, the value must be set to 0.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="segs_color: ">
        <SP>This field contains the vector of colors to use to draw each
        segment. Each element is a color index relative to the current
        colormap.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_mode: ">
        <SP>This field contains the default <VERB>mark_mode</VERB> property
        value for the polyline. Its value should be <VERB>"on"</VERB> (marks
        drawn) or <VERB>"off"</VERB> (no marks drawn).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_style: ">
        <SP>The <VERB>mark_style</VERB> property value is used to select the
        type of mark to use when <VERB>mark_mode</VERB> property is
        <VERB>"on"</VERB>. The value should be an integer in [0 14] which
        stands for: dot, plus, cross, star, filled diamond, diamond, triangle
        up, triangle down, diamond plus, circle, asterisk, square, triangle
        right, triangle left and pentagram.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_size_unit: ">
        <SP>This field contains the default <VERB>mark_size_unit</VERB>
        property value. If <VERB>mark_size_unit</VERB> is set to
        <VERB>"point"</VERB>, then the <VERB>mark_size</VERB> value is
        directly given in points. When <VERB>mark_size_unit</VERB> is set to
        <VERB>"tabulated"</VERB>, <VERB>mark_size</VERB> is computed relative
        to the font size array: therefore, its value should be an integer in
        [0 5] which stands for 8pt, 10pt, 12pt, 14pt, 18pt and 24pt. Note that
        <LINK>plot2d</LINK> and pure scilab functions use
        <VERB>tabulated</VERB> mode as default ; when using <LINK>plot</LINK>
        function, the <VERB>point</VERB> mode is automatically enabled.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_size: ">
        <SP>The <VERB>mark_size</VERB> property is used to select the type of
        size of the marks when <VERB>mark_mode</VERB> property is
        <VERB>"on"</VERB>. Its value should be an integer between 0 and 5
        whith stands for 8pt, 10pt, 12pt, 14pt, 18pt and 24pt.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_foreground: ">
        <SP>This field contains the <VERB>mark_foreground</VERB> property
        value which is the marks' edge color. Its value should be a color
        index (relative to the current color_map).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_background: ">
        <SP>This field contains the <VERB>mark_background</VERB> property
        value which is the marks' face color. Its value should be a color
        index (relative to the current color_map).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="clip_state: ">
        <SP>This field contains the <VERB>clip_state</VERB> property value for
        the segments. It should be :</SP>

        <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
          <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
            <SP><VERB>"off"</VERB> this means that the segments is not
            clipped.</SP>
          </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

          <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
            <SP><VERB>"clipgrf"</VERB> this means that the segments is clipped
            outside the Axes box.</SP>
          </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

          <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
            <SP><VERB>"on"</VERB> this means that the segments is clipped
            outside the rectangle given by the property
            <VERB>clip_box</VERB>.</SP>
          </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
        </DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="clip_box: ">
        <SP>This field contains the <VERB>clip_box</VERB> property. By default
        segment are not clipped, clip_state is "off", so the value should be
        an empty matrix .Other cases the vector <VERB>[x,y,w,h]</VERB>
        (upper-left point width height) defines the portions of the segments
        to display, however <VERB>clip_state</VERB> property value will be
        changed.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="user_data: ">
        <SP>This field can be use to store any scilab variable in the segs
        data structure, and to retreive it.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    </DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
