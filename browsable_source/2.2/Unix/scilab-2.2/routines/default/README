The Fortran routine newfun.f
    generates the source code of the scilab routine
    funtab.f .
    newfun takes the two files fundef and funtab.f and from these
    two files it makes the file funtab.f.new which is the new source code
    of funtab.f. This new funtab.f manages all the primitives defined
    in fundef. 
    fundef is a three columns table: first column = name
    of a primitive  second column = internal coding in scilab third column=
    type of primitive (0 low-level, 1 system function, 2 macro-like primitive)
