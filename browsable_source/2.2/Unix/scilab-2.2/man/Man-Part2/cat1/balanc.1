balanc(2)                      Scilab Function                      balanc(2)






NAME
  balanc - matrix or pencil balancing

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [Ab,X]=balanc(A)
  [Eb,Ab,X,Y]=balanc(E,A)

PARAMETERS
  A:        a real square matrix
  X:        a real square invertible matrix
  E:        a real square matrix (same dimension as A)
  Y:        a real square invertible matrix.

DESCRIPTION
  Balance a square matrix to improve its condition number.
  [Ab,X] = balanc(A) finds a similarity transformation X such that Ab =
  inv(X)*A*X has approximately equal row and column norms.
  For matrix pencils,balancing is done for improving the generalized eigen-
  value problem.
  [Eb,Ab,X,Y] = balanc(E,A) returns left and right transformations X and Y
  such that Eb=X*E*Y Ab=X*A*Y

Remark
  Balancing is made in the functions bdiag and spec.
