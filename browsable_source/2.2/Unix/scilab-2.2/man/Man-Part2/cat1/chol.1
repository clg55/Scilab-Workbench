NAME
  chol - Cholesky factorization

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [R]=chol(X)

PARAMETERS
  X    : a symmetric positive definite real or complex matrix.

DESCRIPTION
  If X is positive definite, then R = chol(X) produces an upper triangular
  matrix R such that R'*R = X.
  chol(X) uses only the diagonal and upper triangle of X.  The lower triangu-
  lar is assumed to be the (complex conjugate) transpose of the upper.
