spaninter(1)                   Scilab Function                   spaninter(1)






NAME
  spaninter - subspace intersection

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [X,dim]=spaninter(A,B [,tol])

PARAMETERS
  A, B      : two real or complex matrices with equal number of rows
  X         : orthogonal or unitary square matrix
  dim       : integer, dimension of subspace range(A) inter range(B)

DESCRIPTION
  [X,dim]=spaninter(A,B) computes the intersection of range(A) and range(B).
  The first dim columns of X span this intersection i.e.  X(:,1:dim) is an
  orthogonal basis for

  range(A) inter range(B)


  In the X basis A and B are respectively represented by:
  X'*A and X'*B.
  tol is a threshold (sqrt(%eps) is the default value).
