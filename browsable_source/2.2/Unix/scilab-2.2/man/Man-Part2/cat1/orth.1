NAME
  orth - orthogonal basis

CALLING SEQUENCE
  Q=orth(A)

PARAMETERS
  A    : real or complex matrix
  Q    : real or complex matrix

DESCRIPTION
  Q=orth(A) returns Q, an orthogonal basis for the span of A.  Range(Q) =
  Range(A) and Q'*Q=eye.
  The number of columns of Q is the rank of A as determined by the QR algo-
  rithm.
