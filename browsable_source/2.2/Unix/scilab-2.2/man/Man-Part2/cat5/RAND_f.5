RAND_f(5)                       Scicos Block                       RAND_f(5)






NAME
  RAND - Scicos random wave generator

DESCRIPTION
  This block is a random wave generator: output takes piecewise constant ran-
  dom values. Everytime an event is received on the input event port, the
  output takes a new independent random value.

DIALOG PARAMETERS
  Block label    : A string defining the block label. This label is placed
                 under the block.
  flag           : 0 or 1. 0 for uniform distribution on [A,A+B] and 1 for
                 normal distribution N(A,B*B).
  A              : scalar
  B              : scalar
  dt             : a scalar. If 0, no ouput event port exists. If dt>0, an
                 output event port exists. This port is initially fired and
                 an event is generated dt after every input event. By feeding
                 back this event output to the event input, a self clocked
                 random wave generator can be constructed.
  Amplitude      : a scalar M.
