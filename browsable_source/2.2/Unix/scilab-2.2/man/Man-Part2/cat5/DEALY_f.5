DELAY_f(5)                      Scicos Block                      DELAY_f(5)






NAME
  TANBLK - Scicos delay block

DIALOG PARAMETERS
  Block label         : A string defining the block label. This label is
                      written under the block.
  Register initial condition
                      : a vector. The initial condition of the regsiter used
                      to store past values of the input.
  Period              : a scalar. The period of the clock which coresponds to
                      the discretization step.

DESCRIPTION
  This block realizes an approximate delay operation. The output at t is a
  discretized (piecewise constant with discretization step equal to Period)
  version of the input at t-dt where dt equals Period times the size of the
  Register.
