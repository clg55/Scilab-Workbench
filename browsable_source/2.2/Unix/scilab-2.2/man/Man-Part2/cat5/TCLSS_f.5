NAME
  TCLSS - Scicos jump continuous-time linear state-space system

DESCRIPTION
  This block realizes a continuous-time linear state-space system with the
  possibility of jumps in the state. The number of inputs to this block
  equals the number of inputs of the linear system plus n the number of
  states of the linear system. When an event arrives at the unique event
  input port of this block, the state of the system jumps to the value
  present on the last n inputs of the block.  The system is defined by the
  (A,B,C,D) matrices and the initial state x0. The dimensions must be compa-
  tible. The number of inputs and outputs are adjusted automatically.

DIALOG PARAMETERS
  Block label         : A string defining the block label. This label is
                      written under the block.
  A                   : square matrix. The A matrix
  B                   : the B matrix
  C                   : the C matrix
  D                   : the D matrix
  x0                  : vector. The initial state of the system.
