NAME
  SCOPXY - Scicos visualization block

DESCRIPTION
  This block realizes the visualization of the evolution of the two regular
  input signals by drawing the second input as a function of the first at
  instants of events on the event input port.

DIALOG PARAMETERS
  Block label         : A string defining the block label. This label is
                      written under the block.
  Curve colors        : an integer. It is the color number (<0) or dash type
                      (>0) used to draw the evolution of the input port sig-
                      nal. See plot2d for color (dash type) definitions.
  Line or mark size   : an integer.
  Output window number
                      : The number of graphic window used for the display. It
                      is often good to use high values to avoid conflict with
                      palettes and Super Block windows. If you have more than
                      one scope, make sure they don't have the same window
                      numbers (unless superposition of the curves is
                      desired).
  Xmin, Xmax          : Minimum and maximum values of the first input; used
                      to set up the X-axis of the plot in the graphics win-
                      dow.
  Ymin, Ymax          : Minimum and maximum values of the second input; used
                      to set up the Y-axis of the plot in the graphics win-
                      dow.
  Buffer size         : To improve efficiency it is possible to buffer the
                      input data. The drawing is only done after each Buffer
                      size call to the block.
