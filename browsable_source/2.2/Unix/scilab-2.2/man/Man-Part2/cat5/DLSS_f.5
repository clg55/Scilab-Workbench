DLSS_f(5)                       Scicos Block                       DLSS_f(5)






NAME
  DLSS - Scicos discrete-time linear state-space system

DESCRIPTION
  This block realizes a discrete-time linear state-space system.  The system
  is defined by the (A,B,C,D) matrices and the initial state x0. The dimen-
  sions must be compatible. At the arrival of an input event on the unique
  input event port, the state is updated. If D is not zero, the the output
  depends directly on the input, so if the input is not the output of a
  discrete block, it may not be piecewise constant.

DIALOG PARAMETERS
  Block label         : A string defining the block label. This label is
                      written under the block.
  A                   : square matrix. The A matrix
  B                   : the B matrix
  C                   : the C matrix
  x0                  : vector. The initial state of the system.
