NAME
  scifunc_block - Scicos block defined interactively

DESCRIPTION
  This block can realize any type of Scicos block. The function of the block
  is defined interactively using dialog boxes and in Scilab language. During
  simulation, these instructions are interpreted by Scilab; the simulation of
  diagrams that include these types of blocks is slower. For more information
  see Scicos reference manual.

DIALOG PARAMETERS
  number of inputs
       : a scalar. Number of regular input ports
  number of outputs
       : a scalar. Number of regular output ports
  number of input events
       : a scalar. Number of input event ports
  number of output events
       : a scalar. Number of output event ports
  Initial continuous state
       : a column vector.
  Initial discrete state
       : a column vector.
  System type
       : a string: z if the block is zero crossing; anything else if it is a
       regular block (c or d for example to specify continuous or discrete).
  System parameter
       : column vector. Any parameters used in the block can be defined here
       a column vector.
  initial firing
       : vector. Size of this vector corresponds to the number of event out-
       puts. The value of the i-th entry specifies the time of the prepro-
       grammed event firing on the i-th output event port. If less than zero,
       no event is preprogrammed.
