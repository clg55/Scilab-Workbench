DLR_f(5)                        Scicos Block                        DLR_f(5)






NAME
  DLR - Scicos discrete-time linear system (transfer function)

DESCRIPTION
  This block realizes a SISO linear system represented by its rational
  transfer function (in the symbolic variable z).  The rational function must
  be proper. If it is not proper, the direct feedthrough make the output
  depend continuously on the input, so if the input is not the output of a
  discrete block, it may not be piece-wise constant.

DIALOG PARAMETERS
  Block label         : A string defining the block label. This label is
                      written under the block.
  Numerator           : a polynomial in z.
  Denomiator          : a polynomial in z.
