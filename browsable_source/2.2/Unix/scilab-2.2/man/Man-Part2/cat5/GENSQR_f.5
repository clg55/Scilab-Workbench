GENSQR_f(5)                     Scicos Block                     GENSQR_f(5)






NAME
  GENSQR - Scicos square wave generator

DESCRIPTION
  This block is a square wave generator: output takes values 0 and M. Every-
  time an event is received on the input event port, the output switches from
  0 to M, or M to 0.

DIALOG PARAMETERS
  Block label    : A string defining the block label. This label is placed
                 under the block.
  dt             : a scalar. If 0, no ouput event port exists. If dt>0, an
                 output event port exists. This port is initially fired and
                 an event is generated dt after every input event. By feeding
                 back this event output to the event input, a self clocked
                 square wave generator can be costructed.
  Amplitude      : a scalar M.
