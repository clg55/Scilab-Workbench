portr3d(1)                     Scilab Function                     portr3d(1)






NAME
  portr3d - 3 dimensional phase portrait.

CALLING SEQUENCE
  []=portr3d(f,[odem,xdim,npts,pinit])

PARAMETERS
  f    : a Scilab external which gives the field of the dynamical system.
       Hence it can be a macro name which computes the field at time t and
       point x [y]=f(t,x,[u]) or a list list(f1,u1) where f1 is a macro of
       type [y]=f1(t,x,u) or a character string
  _r_e_s_t : The other parameters are optional. If omitted they will be asked
       interactively
       odem
         : gives the integration method to use. The value "default" can be
         used, otherwise see ode for a complete set of possibilities
       npts
         :  a vector of size (2,10) [number-of-points,step] gives the step
         for integration and the number of requested points. The solution
         will be calculated and drawn for time=0:step:(step*[number-of-
         points])
       xdim
         : [xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax,zmin,zmax] the boundaries of the graphic
         frame.
       pinit
         : initial values for integration. A set of initial points can be
         given in a matrix
               pinit = [x0(1), x1(1),...., xn(1)
                        x0(2), x1(2),...., xn(2)
                        x0(3), x1(3),...., xn(3)].

DESCRIPTION
  Interactive integration and display of a 3 dimensional phase portrait of a
  dynamical system  dx/dt=f(t,x,[u]) (where u is an optional parameter )
