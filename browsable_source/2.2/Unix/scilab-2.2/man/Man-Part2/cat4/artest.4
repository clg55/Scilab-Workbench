artest(1)                      Scilab Function                      artest(1)






NAME
  artest - arnold dynamical system

CALLING SEQUENCE
  artest(f_l,[odem,xdim,npts])
  arnold(t,x)
  iarf([a])

PARAMETERS
  f_l  : can be "arnold" or arnold. It is the name of the external for the
       arnold system. If f_l is set to "arnold" a Fortran coded version of
       the arnold system where a(1:6)=1 will be used and if f_l is set to
       arnold a Scilab coded version will be used . arnold is a Scilab macro
       coding the Arnold system. This macro is loaded when calling artest.
  iarf : is used to fix the values of a in the Scilab coded case. a is a vec-
       tor of size 6.
  odem,xdim,npts
       : are optional arguments. Their meaning and syntax can be found in the
       portr3d  help
DESCRIPTION
  A call to the function artest() will interactively display a phase portrait
  of  a the following dynamical system :
        ydot(1)=a(1)*cos(y(2)) +a(2)*sin(y(3))
        ydot(2)=a(3)*cos(y(3)) +a(4)*sin(y(1))
        ydot(3)=a(5)*cos(y(1)) +a(6)*sin(y(2))
