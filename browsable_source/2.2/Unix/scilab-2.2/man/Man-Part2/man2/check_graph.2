.SH DESCRIPTION
\fVcheck_graph\fR checks its argument \fVg\fR to see if it is a
graph-list. The checking is not only syntactic (number of elements of the
list, compatible sizes of the vectors), but also semantic in the sense that 
\fVcheck_graph\fR checks that \fVnode_number\fR, \fVtail\fR and
\fVhead\fR elements of the list can really represent a graph.
