circuit(1)                     Scilab function                     circuit(1)






NAME
  circuit - find a circuit or the rank function in a directed graph

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [p,r] = circuit(g)

PARAMETERS
  g : graph-list
  p : row vector of integer numbers of the arcs of the circuit if it exists
  r : row vector of rank function if there is no circuit

DESCRIPTION
  circuit tries to find a circuit for the directed graph g.  It returns the
  circuit p as a row vector of the corresponding arc numbers if it exists and
  it returns the empty vector [] otherwise.  If the graph has no circuit, the
  rank function is returned in r, otherwise its value is the empty vector [].

EXAMPLE
  g=make_graph('foo',1,3,[1 2 3],[2 3 1]);
  circuit(g)
  g=make_graph('foo',1,4,[1 2 2 3],[2 3 4 4]);
  [p,r]=circuit(g)
