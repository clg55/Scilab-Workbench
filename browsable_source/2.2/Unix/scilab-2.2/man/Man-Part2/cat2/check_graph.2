check_graph(1)                 Scilab function                 check_graph(1)






NAME
  check_graph - check a Scilab graph-list

CALLING SEQUENCE
  check_graph(g)

PARAMETERS
  g : graph-list to check

DESCRIPTION
  check_graph checks its argument g to see if it is a graph-list. The check-
  ing is not only syntactic (number of elements of the list, compatible sizes
  of the vectors), but also semantic in the sense that check_graph checks
  that node_number, tail and head elements of the list can really represent a
  graph.

SEE ALSO
