.SH NAME
GENSQR - Scicos square wave generator
.SH DESCRIPTION
This block is a square wave generator: output takes values
0 and M. Everytime an event is received on the input event port,
the output switches from 0 to M, or M to 0.
.SH DIALOG PARAMETERS
.TP 15
Block label
: A string defining the block label. This label is placed under
the block.
.TP
dt
: a scalar. If 0, no ouput event port exists. If dt>0, an output
event port exists. This port is initially fired and an event is
generated dt after every input event. By feeding back this event
output to the event input, a self clocked square wave generator
can be costructed.
.TP
Amplitude
: a scalar M.
