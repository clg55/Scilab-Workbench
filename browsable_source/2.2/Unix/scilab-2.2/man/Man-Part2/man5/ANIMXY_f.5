.SH DIALOG PARAMETERS
.TP 20
Block label
: A string defining the block label. This label is written under
the block. 
.TP
Curve colors
: an integer. It is the color number (<0)
or marker type (>0) used to draw the evolution of the input port
signal. See \fVplot2d\fR for color (dash type) definitions.
.TP
Line or mark size
: an integer. 
.TP
Output window number
: The number of graphic window used for the display. It is often good
to use high values to avoid conflict with palettes and Super Block
windows. If you have more than one scope, make sure they don't have
the same window numbers (unless superposition of the curves is desired).
.TP
Xmin, Xmax
: Minimum and maximum values of the first input; used to set up the X-axis
of the plot in the graphics window.
.TP
Ymin, Ymax
: Minimum and maximum values of the second input; used to set up the 
Y-axis of the plot in the graphics window.
.TP
Buffer size
