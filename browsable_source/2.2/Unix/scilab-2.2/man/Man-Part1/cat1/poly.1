poly(1)                        Scilab Function                        poly(1)






NAME
  poly - polynomial definition

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [p]=poly(a,"x", ["flag"])

PARAMETERS

  a         : matrix or real number

  x         : symbolic variable

  "flag"    : string ("roots", "coeff")

DESCRIPTION
  If a is a matrix, p is the characteristic polynomial i.e.
   determinant(x*eye-a), x being the symbolic variable.

  If v  is a vector, poly(v,"x",["roots"])  is the polynomial with roots the
  entries of v and "x" as formal variable.  (In this case,  roots and   poly
  are inverse functions).

  poly(v,"x","coeff") creates the polynomial with symbol "x" and with coeffi-
  cients the entries of v. (Here poly and coeff are inverse functions).

  s=poly(0,"s") is the seed for defining polynomials with symbol "s".

EXAMPLE
  s=poly(0,"s");p=1+s+2*s^2;
  A=rand(2,2);poly(A,"x")
