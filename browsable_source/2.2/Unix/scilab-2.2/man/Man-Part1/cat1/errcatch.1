NAME
  errcatch - error trapping

CALLING SEQUENCE
  errcatch(n [,'action'] [,'option'])

PARAMETERS

  n         : integer

  action, option      : strings

DESCRIPTION
  errcatch gives an "action" (error-handler)  to be performed when an error
  of type n occurs.

  meaning of n :

  n>0 is the error number to trap

  if n<0  all errors are to be trapped

  action is one of the following character strings  :

       "pause"     : a pause is executed when trapping the error

       "continue"  : next instruction is executed, current instruction is
                   ignored

       "kill"      : default mode.

       "stop"      : interrupts the current Scilab session (useful when Sci-
                   lab is called from an external program).

  option is the character string 'nomessage' for killing error message.
