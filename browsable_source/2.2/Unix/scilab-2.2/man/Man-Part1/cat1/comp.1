NAME
  comp -  function compilation

CALLING SEQUENCE
  comp(function-name)

DESCRIPTION
  comp(function-name) compiles the function function-name.  Compiled and
  interpreted functions are equivalent but usually compiled functions are
  much faster.  The functions provided in the standard libraries are com-
  piled.  Un-compiled versions exist (entering a library-name returns the
  names of the un-compiled corresponding functions)

  The command: getf('filename','c') loads the functions in file 'filename'
  and compiles them.

REMARKS
  commands who, help, what cannot be compiled.
