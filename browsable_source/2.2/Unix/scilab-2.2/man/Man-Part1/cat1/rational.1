NAME
  "Scilab object : rationals" - rational in Scilab

DESCRIPTION
  A rational r is a quotient of two polynomials r=num/den.  The internal
  representation of a rational is a list.  r=list('r',num,den,[]) is the same
  as r=num/den.  A rational matrix can be defined with the usual syntax e.g.
  [r11,r12;r21,r22] is a 2x2 matrix where rij are 1x1 rationals.  A rational
  matrix can also be defined as above as a list list('r',num,den,[]) with num
  and den polynomial matrices.

EXAMPLES
  s=poly(0,'s');
  W=[1/s,1/(s+1)]
  W'*W
  Num=[s,s+2;1,s];Den=[s*s,s;s,s*s];
  list('r',Num,Den,[])
  H=Num./Den
  syslin('c',Num,Den)
  syslin('c',H)
  [Num1,Den1]=simp(Num,Den)
