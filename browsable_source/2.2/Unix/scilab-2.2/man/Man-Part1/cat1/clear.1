clear(1)                       Scilab Function                       clear(1)






NAME
  clear - kills variables

CALLING SEQUENCE
  clear a

DESCRIPTION
  This command kills variables which are not protected.  It removes the named
  variables from the environment.  By itself clear kills all the variables
  except the variables protected by predef. Thus the two commands predef(0)
  and clear remove all the variables.

  Normally, protected variables are standard libraries and variables with the
  percent prefix.

  Note the particular syntax clear a and not clear(a). Note also that a=[]
  does not kill a but sets a to an empty matrix.
