read(1)                        Scilab Function                        read(1)






NAME
  read - matrices read

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [x]=read(file-desc,m,n,[format])
  [x]=read(file-desc,m,n,k,format)

PARAMETERS

  file-desc : character string specifying the file name or integer value
            specifying logical unit (see file).

  m, n      : integers (dimensions of the matrix x). Set m=-1 if you dont
            know the numbers of rows, so the whole file is read.

  format : character string, specifies a "fortran" format. This
            character string must begin with a right parenthesis and end with
            a left parenthesis.  Formats cannot mix floating point or charac-
            ter edition modes.

  k         : integer

DESCRIPTION
  reads row after row the mxn matrix x (n=1 for character chain) in the file
  file-desc (string or integer).  Each row of the matrix x begin in a new
  line of file-desc file. Depending on format a given row of the x matrix may
  be read from more than one line of file-desc file.

  The type of the result will depend on the specified form. If form is
  numeric (d,e,f,g) the matrix will be a scalar matrix and if form contains
  the character a the matrix will be a matrix of character strings. In this
  case n must be equal to 1.


  Examples for format:
  (1x,e10.3,5x,3(f3.0))
  (10x,a20)

  When format is omitted datas are read using numerical free format:
  blank, comma and shash may be used as data separators, n*v may be use
  to represent n occurences of value n.


  A direct access file can be used if using the parameter k which is
  is the vector of record numbers to be read (one record per row),
  thus m must be m=prod(size(k)).

  To read on the keyboard use read(%io(1),...).


EXAMPLE
  unix('rm foo')
  A=rand(3,5); write('foo',A);
  B=read('foo',3,5)
  B=read('foo',-1,5)
  read(%io(1),1,1,'(a)')  // waits for user's input
