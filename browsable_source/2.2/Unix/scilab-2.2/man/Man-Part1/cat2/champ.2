NAME
  champ - draw a 2d vector field

CALLING SEQUENCE
  champ(x,y,fx,fy [,arfact,rect,strf])
  champ1(x,y,fx,fy [,arfact,rect,strf])

PARAMETERS

  x,y       : two vectors which define the grid.

  fx        : a matrix which describes the x component of the vector field.
            fx(i,j) is the x component of the vector field at point
            (x(i),y(j)).

  fy        : a matrix which describes the y component of the vector field.
            fy(i,j) is the y component of the vector field at point
            (x(i),y(j)).

  arfact    : an optional argument of type real which gives a scale factor
            for the display of the arrow heads on the plot (default value is
            1.0)

  rect      : a vector  rect=[xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax] which gives the boundaries
            of the graphic frame to use.

  strf      : is a string of length 3 "xyz" which has the same meaning as the
            strf parameter of plot2d. The parameter "x" has no effect with
            champ.

DESCRIPTION
  champ draws a 2d vector field. If ones uses champ the length of the arrows
  are proportional to the field intensity and if one uses champ1 (with a
  color screen) the color of the arrow depends on the intensity of the field.

  Enter the command champ() to see a demo.

EXAMPLE
  // using rect has graphic boundaries
  champ(-5:5,-5:5,rand(11,11),rand(11,11),1,[-10,-10,10,10],"011");
  xgrid();
  xbasc();
  // using (x,y) to get boundaries
  champ(-5:5,-5:5,rand(11,11),rand(11,11),2,[-10,-10,10,10],"021");
  // using coloured arrows
  xset("use color",1)
  champ1(-5:5,-5:5,rand(11,11),rand(11,11),2,[-10,-10,10,10],"021");
