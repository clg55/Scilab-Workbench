plot2d1(2)                     Scilab Function                     plot2d1(2)






NAME
  plot2d1 - multiple plot of functions

CALLING SEQUENCE
  plot2d1(str,x,y,[style,strf,leg,rect,nax])

PARAMETERS

  str  : is a string of length three "abc"

       a : can have the following values : e | o | g

         e : means empty and specifies the fact that the value of x won't be
           used ( the x values are supposed to be regularly spaced) . The
           user must anyway give a value to the x parameter when calling
           plot2d1, for example plot2d1("enn",1,y).

         o : stands for one. if there are many curves, they all have the same
           x-values ( x is of size x(n,1) and y of size y(n,n1). for example
           :
            plot2d1("onn",(1:10)',[sin(1:10);cos(1:10)]')

         g : stands for general. x and y must then have the same size

       b,c
         : can have the values  n or l.

         b=l       : a logarithmic axis is used on the X-axis

         c=l       : a logarithmic axis is used on the Y-axis

DESCRIPTION
  plot2d1 simultaneously plot a set of 2D curves.  Same as plot2d but with
  one more argument str which enables logarithmic axis, and less specifica-
  tion for x.
