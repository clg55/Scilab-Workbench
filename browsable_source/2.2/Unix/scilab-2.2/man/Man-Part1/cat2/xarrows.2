NAME
  xarrows - draw a set of arrows

CALLING SEQUENCE
  []=xarrows(nx,ny,[arsize,style])

PARAMETERS

  nx   : real matrix of size (n1,n2)

  ny   : real matrix of size (n1,n2)

  arsize
       : real scalar (size of the arrow head). The default value can be
       obtained by setting arsize to value -1.0.

  style
       : a matrix of size n or a scalar. If style is a positive scalar it
       gives the dash style to use for all segments, if it is a negative
       scalar then current dash style is used, if it is a vector style[i]
       gives the style to use for segment i.

DESCRIPTION
  This function draws a set of arrows which are given by the vector or
  matrices nx and ny.  The ith arrow is defined by (nx(i),ny(i))--
  >(nx(i+1),ny(i+1)).  nx, ny can also be matrices :
  nx=[ xi_1,x1_2,...; xf_1,xf_2,...]
  ny=[ yi_1,y1_2,...; yf_1,yf_2,...]
  in which case the arrows are  (xi_k,yi_k)->(xf_k,yf_k)

  This function uses the current graphic scale which can be set by calling a
  high level drawing function such as plot2d.

EXAMPLE
  x=2*%pi*(0:9)/8;
  x1=[sin(x);9*sin(x)];
  y1=[cos(x);9*cos(x)];
  plot2d([-10,10],[-10,10],[-1,-1],"022");
  xset('clipgrf')
  xarrows(x1,y1,1,0:9);
  xset('clipoff')

SEE ALSO
  plot2d, xchange.
