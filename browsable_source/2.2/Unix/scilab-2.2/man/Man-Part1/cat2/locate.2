DESCRIPTION
  This function is used to get the coordinates of one or more points selected
  with the mouse on a graphic window. The coordinates are given using the
  current graphic scale.

  x=locate(n)    : if n>0, n points are selected and their coordinates are
                 returned in x(2,n)

  x=locate(n)    : If n<=0 points are selected until the user click with the
                 left button which stands for stop. The last point ( clicked
                 with the left button) is not returned.

  x=locate()     : same as x=locate(-1)

  If flag = 1 a cross is drawn at location point each time the mouse is
  clicked.
