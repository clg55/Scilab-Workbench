NAME
  xpolys - draw a set of polylines

CALLING SEQUENCE
  []=xpolys(xpols,ypols,[draw])

PARAMETERS

  xpols, ypols   : matrices of size (p,n)

  draw           : vector of size n

  If draw(i) is positive the mark of id draw(i) is used to draw the polyline
  i.

  If draw(i) is negative the line style of id abs(draw(i)) is used to draw
  the polyline i.
