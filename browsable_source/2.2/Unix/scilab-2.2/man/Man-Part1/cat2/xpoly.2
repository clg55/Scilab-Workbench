NAME
  xpoly - draw a single polyline

CALLING SEQUENCE
  []=xpoly(xv,yv,dtype[,close])

PARAMETERS

  xv, yv         : two matrices of the same size (p,n)  (points of the poly-
                 line)

  dtype          : string (drawing style)

  close          : if close = 1, the polyline is closed. (default value is 0)

DESCRIPTION
  draws a single polyline described by (xv,yv). If xv and yv are matrices
  they are internally considered as a vector using the Fortran internal
  storage convention.  dtype can be "lines" for using the current line style
  or "marks" for using the current mark to draw the polyline.
