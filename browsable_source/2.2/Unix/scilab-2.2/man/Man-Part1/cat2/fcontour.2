NAME
  fcontour - level curves

CALLING SEQUENCE
  fcontour(xr,yr,f,nz,[theta,alpha,caption,flag,bbox,zlev])

PARAMETERS

  xr,yr     : two real vectors of size respectively (1,n1) and (1,n2).

  f         : is an external which gives the analytic expression of the sur-
            face.  z=f(x,y) is first computed on the grid specified by xr.yr.
            Then, control is passed to the routine contour.

  nz        : specifies the level values or number.

            - If nz is of size 1, its value considered as an integer gives
              the number of level curves equally spaced from zmin to zmax.

            - If nz is a vector, nz(j) gives the value of the jth level
              curve.

  [rest]    : for theta,alpha,caption, bbox see plot3d

  flag      : real vector of size 3 ; flag=[mode,type,box]; flag(2) and
            flag(3) are the same as in plot3d; flag(1) has the following
            meaning :

            flag(1)=0      : the level curves are drawn on the surface
                           defined by (x,y,z)

            flag(1)=1      : the level curves are drawn on a 3D plot and on
                           the plan defined by equation z=zlev

            flag(1)=2      : The level curves are drawn on a 2D plot.

DESCRIPTION
  Draws the level curves of a surface z=f(x,y)
