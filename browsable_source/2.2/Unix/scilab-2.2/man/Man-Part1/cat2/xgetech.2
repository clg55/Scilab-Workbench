NAME
  xgetech - get the current graphic 2d scale

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [frect1,frect,[logflag]]=xgetech()

PARAMETERS

  frect1, frect  : real vectors (rect. def)

  logflag   : a string of size 2 "xy".

DESCRIPTION
  This function returns the current graphic scale.  If one uses the current
  graphic scale, the points in the frect rectangle [xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax] will
  be drawn in the the region of the current graphic window specified by
  frect1.

  frect1=[x,y,w,h] ( Upper-Left Width Height ) describes a region inside the
  graphic window. The values in wrect1 are specified using proportion
   of the width or height of the graphic window.

  frect1=[0,0,1.0,1.0] means that all the graphic window will be used.

  frect1=[0.5,0,0.5,1.0] means that the graphic region will be the right half
  of the graphic window.  The logflag is a string of size 2 "xy", where x and
  y can be "n" or "l". It gives information on the log scale status for the
  current scale, "n" stands for normal and "l" for logscale. x is for the x-
  axis and y for the y-axis.
