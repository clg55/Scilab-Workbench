NAME
  xsegs - draw unconnected segments

CALLING SEQUENCE
  xsegs(nx,ny,[style])

PARAMETERS

  nx,ny          : two matrices of the same size 2*n

  style          : a matrix of size n or a scalar. If style is a positive
                 scalar it gives the dash style to use for all segments, if
                 it is a negative scalar then current dash style is used, if
                 it is a vector style[i] gives the style to use for segment
                 i.

DESCRIPTION
  this function draws a set of unconnected segments given by nx,ny which are
  internally considered as vectors ( using the Fortran storage convention).
  The coordinates of the two points defining a segment are given by two con-
  secutive values of nx and ny.

  (nx[i],ny[i])-->(nx[i+1],nx[i+2])

  Using matrices of size (2,.) the segments can be defined by
  nx=[ xi_1,xi_
       xf_1,xf_2,...  ]

  ny=[ yi_1,yi_2,.....;
      yf_1,yf_2,...  ]
  the segments are then (xi_k,yi_k)->(xf_k,yf_k)

EXAMPLE
  x=2*%pi*(0:9)/8;
  x1=[sin(x);9*sin(x)];
  y1=[cos(x);9*cos(x)];
  plot2d([-10,10],[-10,10],[-1,-1],"022");
  xset('clipgrf')
  xsegs(x1,y1,0:9);
  xset('clipoff')
