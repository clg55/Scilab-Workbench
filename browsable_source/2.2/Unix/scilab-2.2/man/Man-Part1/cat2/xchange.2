NAME
  xchange - coordinates transform

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [x1,y1,rect]=xchange(x,y,dir)

PARAMETERS

  x,y       : two matrices of size (n1,n2) (coordinates of a set of points)

  x1,y1     : two matrices of size (n1,n2) (coordinates of the set of points
            )

  rect      : a vector of size 4 (values in pixel of the coordinates of the
            rectangle in which the scale was fixed)

DESCRIPTION
  After having used a graphic function, this function allows one to change
  real coordinates into pixel coordinates and vice-versa, according to the
  value of the parameter dir.  dir = 'f2i' or 'i2f' ( float to int or int to
  float)
   x1,y1 are the coordinates of the set of points described by x,y after the
  coordinate change.
