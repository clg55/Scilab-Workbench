NAME
  plot3di - surface plotting with interactive view selection

CALLING SEQUENCE
  plot3d(x,y,z,theta,alpha,leg,flag,ebox)
  plot3d(x,y,z,theta,alpha,leg,[flag,ebox)]

PARAMETERS

  x,y            : matrices of sizes (1,n1) and (1,n2) (point coordinates)

  z              : matrix of size (n1,n2) ( z(i,j) : value of f at the point
                 (x(i),y(j))

  theta, alpha   : real values giving in degree the initial spherical coordi-
                 nates of the observation point

  leg            : string (captions for each axis. this is string with @ as a
                 field separator, for example : "X@Y@Z")

  flag           : is a real vector of size three flag=[mode,type,box]

                 mode
                   : string (treatment of hidden parts)

                   mode >=2
                     the hidden parts of the surface are removed and the sur-
                     face is painted in gray (from low gray to black accord-
                     ing to the value of mode)

                   mode = 1
                     the hidden parts of the surface are drawn

                   mode <= 0
                     only the shadow of the surface is painted with a gray
                     level depending on mode

                 type
                   : scaling

                   if type = 0    the plot is made using the current 3D scal-
                                  ing ( set by a previous call to param3d,
                                  plot3d, contour, plot3d1)

                   if type = 1    the boundaries are specified by the value
                                  of the parameter

                   ebox=[xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax,zmin,zmax]

                   else the boundaries are computed with the given datas.

                 box
                   : frame display around the plot.

                   box=0
                     nothing is drawn around the plot

                   box=1
                     unimplemented ( like box=0 )

                   box=2
                     only the axes behind the surface are drawn

                   box=3
                     a box surrounding the surface is drawn and captions are
                     added

                   box=4
                     a box surrounding the surface is drawn, captions are
                     added and axes too.

DESCRIPTION
  Draw the surface f(x,y) defined by a matrix of coordinates and allow the
  user to change the view with the mouse :


  Pick a point within the graphic window (Left mouse button) and drag the
  mouse (theta increases for left to right move and alpha increases for down
  to up move). When view is ok click with the left button to have the surface
  drawn. click rigth button  to exit.


  For Pos and Fig drivers plot3di works just like plot3d


EXAMPLE
  enter the command  plot3di() to see a demo

  another example :

  plot3di(1:10,1:20,10*rand(10,20),35,45,"X@Y@Z",[2,2,3])
