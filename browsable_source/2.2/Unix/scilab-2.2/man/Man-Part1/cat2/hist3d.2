NAME
  hist3d - 3D representation of an histogram

CALLING SEQUENCE
  hist3d(f [,theta,alpha,leg,flag,ebox])

PARAMETERS

  f         : matrix or list :

            - matrix f(i,j)= F(x(i),y(j)),  x and y  taken as 0:m and 0:n, (
              (m,n) is the size of f).

            - list of size 3; list(f,x,y) where f is a matrix of size (m,n)
              and x and y two vectors of size (1,n+1) and (1,m+1)

  rest      : see plot3d

DESCRIPTION
  3 dimensional representation of an 2d histogram : the values associated to
  the intervals ([x(i) x(i+1)[ X [y(i) y(i+1)[)
