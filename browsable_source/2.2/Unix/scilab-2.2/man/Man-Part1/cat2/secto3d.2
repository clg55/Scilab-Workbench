NAME
  secto3d - 3D surfaces conversion

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [m[,x]]=secto3d(seclist,npas)
  [m]=secto3d(seclist ,x)

PARAMETERS

  seclist        : a list whose elements are (2,.) matrices

  npas           : an integer

  m              : a matrix

  x              : a vector

DESCRIPTION
  Considering a surface given through a list seclist of sections in the (x,z)
  plane  [m [,x]]=secto3d(seclist [,npas]) returns a matrix m which contains
  a regular discretisation of the surface.

  -    The i-th row of the matrix m corresponds to the i-th section

  -    The j-th column of m corresponds to the x(j)

  Each section seclist(i) is described by a (2,.) matrix which gives respec-
  tively the x and z coordinates of points.

  [m]=secto3d(seclist ,x) : in that case the x-vector gives the discretisa-
  tion of the x-axis for all the sections
