NAME
  xfarc - fill a part of an ellipsis

CALLING SEQUENCE
  []=xfarc(x,y,w,h,a1,a2)

PARAMETERS

  x,y,w,h        : real scalars (rectangle def)

  a1,a2          : real scalars (angle def)

DESCRIPTION
  Fills a portion of an ellipsis contained in the rectangle (x,y,w,h) (
  upper-left point, width, height), and in the sector delimited by the angle
  alpha1 and the angle alpha1+alpha2. alpha1 and alpha2 are given respec-
  tively by a1/64 degrees and a2/64 degrees.  This function uses the current
  graphic state which can be set by calling a high level drawing function
  such as plot2d.

EXAMPLE
  // isoview scaling
  plot2d(0,0,-1,"031"," ",[-2,-2,2,2])
  xfarc(-0.5,0.5,1,1,0,90*64)
  xset("pattern",2)
  xfarc(0.5,0.5,1,1,0,360*64)
