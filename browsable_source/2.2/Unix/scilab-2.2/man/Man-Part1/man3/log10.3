.SH DESCRIPTION
decimal logarithm.If \fVx\fR is a vector \fVlog10(x)=[log10(x1),...,log10(xn)]\fR.
If \fVx\fR is a matrix \fVlog10(x)\fR is the matrix logarithm of \fVx\fR.
The result is complex if \fVx\fR is not positive or definite positive.
If \fVx\fR is a  symmetric matrix, then calculation is made by
schur form. Otherwise, \fVx\fR is assumed diagonalizable.
