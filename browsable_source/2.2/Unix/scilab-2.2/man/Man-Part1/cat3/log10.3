log10(1)                       Scilab Function                       log10(1)






NAME
  log - logarithm

CALLING SEQUENCE
  y=log10(x)

PARAMETERS

  x         : constant, vector or matrix

DESCRIPTION
  decimal logarithm.If x is a vector log10(x)=[log10(x1),...,log10(xn)].  If
  x is a matrix log10(x) is the matrix logarithm of x.  The result is complex
  if x is not positive or definite positive.  If x is a  symmetric matrix,
  then calculation is made by schur form. Otherwise, x is assumed diagonaliz-
  able.
