diag(1)                        Scilab Function                        diag(1)






NAME
  diag - diagonal including or extracting

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [y]=diag(vm, [k])

PARAMETERS

  vm        : vector or matrix

  k         : integer (default value 0)

  y         : vector or matrix

DESCRIPTION
  for vm a (row or column) n-vector diag(vm) returns a diagonal matrix with
  entries of vm along the main diagonal.

  diag(vm,k) is a  (n+abs(k))x(n+abs(k)) matrix with the entries of vm  along
  the kth diagonal.  k=0  is the main diagonal k>0 is for upper diagonals and
  k<0 for lower diagonals.

  For a matrix vm, diag(vm,k) is the column vector made of entries of the kth
  diagonal of vm.  diag(vm) is the main diagonal of vm.  diag(diag(x))  is a
  diagonal matrix.

  To construct a diagonal linear system, use sysdiag.

  Note that eye(A).*A returns a diagonal matrix made with the diagonal
  entries of A. This is valid for any matrix (constant, polynomial, rational,
  state-space linear system,...).

  For example
  diag(-m:m) +  diag(ones(2*m,1),1) +diag(ones(2*m,1),-1)
  gives a tri-diagonal matrix of order 2*m+1
