delip(1)                       Scilab Function                       delip(1)






NAME
  delip - elliptic integral

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [r]=delip(x,ck)

DESCRIPTION
  returns the value of the elliptic integral with parameter ck :

  r=integral from 0 to x {dt / sqrt((1-t^2)*(1-ck^2*t^2))}



  x real and positive.  When called with x a real vector r is evaluated at
  each coordinate of x.
