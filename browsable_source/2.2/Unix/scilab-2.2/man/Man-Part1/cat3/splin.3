NAME
  splin - spline function

CALLING SEQUENCE
  splin(x,f [,"periodic"])

PARAMETERS

  x         : real vector

  f         : real vector of same size as x

  "periodic"
            : string flag (a periodic spline is looked for)

DESCRIPTION
  Given values fi of a function f at given points xi (fi=f(xi)) this primi-
  tive computes a third order spline function S which interpolates the func-
  tion f.  The components of x must be in increasing order.  For a periodic
  spline f(1) must equal f(n); S is defined through the triple (x,f,d) where
  d=spline(x,f) is the vector of the estimated derivatives of S at xi
  (fi=S(xi),di=S'(xi)).  This function should be used in conjunction with
  interp.
