SIMP(G)                        Scilab Function                        SIMP(G)






NAME
  simp - rational simplification

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [N1,D1]=simp(N,D)
  H1=simp(H)

PARAMETERS

  N,D  : real polynomials or real matrix polynomials

  H    : rational matrix (i.e matrix with entries n/d ,n and d real polynomi-
       als)

DESCRIPTION
  [n1,d1]=simp(n,d) calculates two polynomials n1 and d1 such that n1/d1 =
  n/d.

  If N and D are polynomial matrices the calculation is performed element-
  wise.

  H1=simp(H) is also valid (each entry of H is simplified in H1).

  Caution:

  -no threshold is given i.e. simp cannot forces a simplification.

  -For linear dynamic systems which include integrator(s) simplification
  changes the static gain. (H(0) for continuuous systems or H(1) for discrete
  systems)
