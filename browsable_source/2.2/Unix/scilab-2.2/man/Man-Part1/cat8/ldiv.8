ldiv(1)                        Scilab Function                        ldiv(1)






NAME
  ldiv - polynomial matrix long division

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [x]=ldiv(n,d,k)

PARAMETERS

  n,d  : two real polynomial matrices

  k    : integer

DESCRIPTION
  x=ldiv(n,d,k) gives the k first coefficients  of the long division of n by
  d i.e.  the Taylor expansion of the rational matrix [nij(z)/dij(z)] near
  infinity.

  Coefficients of expansion of nij/dij are stored in x((i-1)*n+k,j)  k=1:n
