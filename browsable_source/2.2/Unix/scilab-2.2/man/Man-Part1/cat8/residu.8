NAME
  residu - residue

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [V]=residu(P,Q1,Q2)

PARAMETERS

  P, Q1, Q2
       : polynomials or matrix polynomials with real or complex coefficients.

DESCRIPTION
  returns the matrix V such that V(i,j) is the sum of the residues of the
  rational fraction P(i,j)/(Q1(i,j)*Q2(i,j)) calculated at the zeros of
  Q1(i,j).

  Q1(i,j) and Q2(i,j) must not have any common root.
