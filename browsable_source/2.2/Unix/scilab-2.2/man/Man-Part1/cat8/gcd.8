gcd(8)                         Scilab Function                         gcd(8)






NAME
  gcd - gcd calculation

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [pgcd,U]=gcd(p)

PARAMETERS

  p    : polynomial row vector p=[p1,..,pn]

DESCRIPTION
  [pgcd,u]=gcd(p) computes the gcd  of components of p and a unimodular
  matrix (with polynomial inverse) U, with minimal degree such that

  p*U=[0 ... 0 pgcd]

EXAMPLE
  s=poly(0,'s');
  p=[s,s*(s+1)^2,2*s^2+s^3];
  [pgcd,u]=gcd(p);
  p*u
