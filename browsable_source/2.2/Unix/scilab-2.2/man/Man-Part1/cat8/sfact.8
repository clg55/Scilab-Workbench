NAME
  sfact - discrete spectral factorization

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [F]=sfact(P)

PARAMETERS

  P    : real polynomial matrix

DESCRIPTION
  Finds a spectral factor of P. P is a polynomial matrix assumed such that
  each root of P has a mirror image w.r.t the unit circle.

  sfact(P) returns a Hurwitz (stable) polynomial matrix such that

  P = F(z)* F(1/z) *z^n

  For scalar polynomials a specific algorithm is implemented.  Algorithms are
  from Kucera's book.
