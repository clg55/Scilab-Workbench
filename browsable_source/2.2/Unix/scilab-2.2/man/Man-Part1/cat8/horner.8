horner(1)                      Scilab Function                      horner(1)






NAME
  horner - polynomial/rational evaluation

CALLING SEQUENCE
  horner(P,x)

PARAMETERS

  P    : polynomial or rational matrix

  x    : real number or polynomial or rational

DESCRIPTION
  evaluates the polynomial or rational matrix P = P(s) when the variable s of
  the polynomial is replaced by x:

  horner(P,x)=P(x)

  Example (Bilinear transform): Assume P = P(s) is a rational matrix  then
  the rational matrix P((1+s)/(1-s)) is obtained by horner(P,(1+s)/(1-s)).

  To evaluate a rational matrix at given frequencies use preferably the freq
  primitive.

EXAMPLES
  s=poly(0,'s');M=[s,1/s];
  horner(M,1)
  horner(M,%i)
  horner(M,1/s)
