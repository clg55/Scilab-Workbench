.SH PARAMETERS
.TP 10
y 
: real vector or polynomial in \fVz^-1\fR, it contains the
coefficients of the Fourier's series of the rational system to
approximate (the impulse response)
.TP
den0
: a polynomial which gives an initial guess of the solution, it may be
\fVpoly(1,'z','c')\fR
.TP
n 
: integer, the degree of approximating transfer function (degree of
den)
.TP
imp 
: integer in \fV(0,1,2)\fR (verbose mode)
.TP
den
: polynomial or vector of polynomials, contains the denominator(s) of
the solution(s)
.TP
num
: polynomial or vector of polynomials, contains the numerator(s) of
the solution(s)
.TP
err
: real constant or vector , the l2-error achieved for each solutions
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fV[den,num,err]=arl2(y,den0,n [,imp]) \fR finds a pair of polynomials
\fVnum\fR and \fVden\fR such that the transfer function \fVnum/den\fR
is stable and it's impulse response approximates (with a minimal l2
norm) the vector \fVy\fR assumed to be completed by an infinite number
of zeros. 

.IG	
If y(z)  =  y(1)(1/z)+y(2)(1/z^2)+ ...+ y(ny)(1/z^ny) 
.FI
.LA If~:$$ y(z)= y(1)({ 1 \over z})+y(2)({ 1 \over z})^2+\dots
.LA  + y(ny)({ 1 \over z})^ny $$
then l2-norm of \fVnum/den - y(z)\fR is \fVerr\fR.
.LP
\fVn\fR is the degree of the polynomial \fVden\fR.
.LP
The \fVnum/den\fR  transfer function is a L2 approximant of the 
.LP
Various intermediate results are printed according to \fVimp\fR.

.LP
\fV[den,num,err]=arl2(y,den0,n [,imp],'all') \fR  returns in the
vectors of polynomials \fVnum\fR and \fVden\fR  a set of local
optimums for the problem. The solutions are sorted with increasing
errors \fVerr\fR. In this case \fVden0\fR is already assumed to be 
\fVpoly(1,'z','c')\fR
