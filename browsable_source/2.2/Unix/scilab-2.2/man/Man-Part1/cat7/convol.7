convol(1)                      Scilab Function                      convol(1)






NAME
  convol - convolution

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [y]=convol(h,x)
  [y,e1]=convol(h,x,e0)

PARAMETERS

  x,h       :input sequences (h is a "short" sequence, x a "long" one)

  e0        : old tail to overlap add (not used in first call)

  y         : output of convolution

  e1        : new tail to overlap add (not used in last call)

DESCRIPTION
  calculates the convolution y= h*x of two discrete sequences by using the
  fft.  Overlap add method can be used.

  USE OF OVERLAP ADD METHOD: For x=[x1,x2,...,xNm1,xN] First call is
  [y1,e1]=convol(h,x1); Subsequent calls : [yk,ek]=convol(h,xk,ekm1); Final
  call : [yN]=convol(h,xN,eNm1); Finally y=[y1,y2,...,yNm1,yN]

SEE ALSO
  corr,fft,pspec and polynomial product.
