phc(1)                         Scilab Function                         phc(1)






NAME
  phc - from the hankel matrix to state-space model

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [H,F,G]=phc(hk,d,r)

PARAMETERS

  hk            : hankel matrix

  d             : dimension of the observation

  r             : desired dimension of the state vector for the approximated
                model

  H, F, G       : relevant matrices of the state-space model

DESCRIPTION
  function which computes the matrices H, F, G by the principal hankel com-
  ponent approximation method, from the hankel matrix built from the covari-
  ance sequence of a stochastic process.
