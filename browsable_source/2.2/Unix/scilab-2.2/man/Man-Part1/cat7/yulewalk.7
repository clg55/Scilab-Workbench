NAME
  yulewalk -  least-square filter design

CALLING SEQUENCE
  Hz = yulewalk(N,frq,mag)

PARAMETERS

  N         : integer (order of derired filter)

  frq       : real row vector (non-decreasing order), frequencies.

  mag       : non negative real row vector (same size as frq), desired magni-
            tudes.

  Hz        : filter B(z)/A(z)

DESCRIPTION
  Hz = yulewalk(N,frq,mag) finds the N-th order iir filter
                    n-1         n-2
        B(z)   b(1)z     + b(2)z    + .... + b(n)
  H(z)= ---- = ---------------------------------
                  n-1       n-2
        A(z)    z   + a(1)z    + .... + a(n)
  which matches the magnitude frequency response given by vectors frq and
  mag.  Vectors frq and mag specify the frequency and magnitude of the
  desired frequency response. The frequencies in frq must be between 0.0 and
  1.0, with 1.0 corresponding to half the sample rate. They must be in
  increasing order and start with 0.0 and end with 1.0.

EXAMPLE
  // f=[0,0.4,0.4,0.6,0.6,1];H=[0,0,1,1,0,0];Hz=yulewalk(8,f,H);
  //fs=1000;fhz = f*fs/2; //xbasc(0);xset('window',0);plot2d(fhz',H');
  //xtitle('Desired Frequency Response (Magnitude)')
  //[frq,repf]=repfreq(Hz,0:0.001:0.5);
  //xbasc(1);xset('window',1);plot2d(fs*frq',abs(repf')); //xtitle('Obtained
  Frequency Response (Magnitude)')
