ffilt(1)                       Scilab Function                       ffilt(1)






NAME
  ffilt - coefficients of FIR low-pass

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [x]=ffilt(ft,n,fl,fh)

PARAMETERS

  ft        : filter type where ft can take the values

            "lp" : for low-pass filter

            "hp" : for high-pass filter

            "bp" : for band-pass filter

            "sb" : for stop-band filter

  n         : integer (number of filter samples desired)

  fl        : real (low frequency cut-off)

  fh        : real (high frequency cut-off)

  x         : vector of filter coefficients

DESCRIPTION
  Get n coefficients of a FIR low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, or stop-band
  filter.  For low and high-pass filters one cut-off frequency must be speci-
  fied whose value is given in fl. For band-pass and stop-band filters two
  cut-off frequencies must be specified for which the lower value is in fl
  and the higher value is in fh
