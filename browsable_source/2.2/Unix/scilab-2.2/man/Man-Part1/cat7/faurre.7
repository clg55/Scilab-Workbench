faurre(1)                      Scilab Function                      faurre(1)






NAME
  faurre - filter

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [Pn,Rt,T]=faurre(n,H,F,G,r0)

PARAMETERS

  n           : number of iterations.

  H, F, G     : estimated triple from the covariance sequence of y.

  r0          : E(yk*yk')

  Pn          : solution of the Riccati equation after n iterations.

  Rt, T       : gain matrix of the filter.

DESCRIPTION
  function which computes iteratively the minimal solution of the algebraic
  Riccati equation and gives the matrices Rt and Tt of the filter model.
