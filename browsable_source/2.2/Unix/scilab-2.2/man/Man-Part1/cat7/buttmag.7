buttmag(1)                     Scilab Function                     buttmag(1)






NAME
  buttmag -  response of Butterworth filter

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [h]=buttmag(order,omegac,sample)

PARAMETERS

  order     : integer : filter order

  omegac    : real : cut-off frequency in Hertz

  sample    : vector of frequency where buttmag is evaluated

  h         : Butterworth filter values at sample points

DESCRIPTION
