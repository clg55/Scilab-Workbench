corr(G)                        Scilab Function                        corr(G)






NAME
  corr - correlation, covariance

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [cov,mean]=corr(x,[y],nlags)
  [cov,mean]=corr('fft',xmacro,[ymacro],n,sect)

  [w,xu]=corr('updt',x1,[y1],w0)
  [w,xu]=corr('updt',x2,[y2],w,xu)
   ...
  [wk]=corr('updt',xk,[yk],w,xu)

DESCRIPTION
  Computes

                  n - m - 1
                   ====
                           cov(m) =  >        (x  - xmean) (y      - ymean)
                   /           k            m + k
                   ====
                   k = 0


  for   m=0,..,nlag-1 and two vectors x=[x(1),..,x(n)]
   y=[y(1),..,y(n)]

  Note that if x and y sequences are differents corr(x,y,...) is different
  with corr(y,x,...)

  [1mShort     sequences

  [0m[cov,mean]=corr(x,[y],nlags) returns the first nlags correlation coeffi-
  cients and mean = mean of x (mean of [x,y] if y is an argument).  The
  sequence x (resp. y) is assumed real, and x and y are of same dimension n.

  [1mLong sequences

  [0m[cov,mean]=corr('fft',xmacro,[ymacro],n,sect)

  Here xmacro is either

  -    a function of type [xx]=xmacro(sect,istart) which returns a vector xx
       of dimension nsect containing the part of the sequence with indices
       from istart to istart+sect-1.

  -    a fortran subroutine which performs the same calculation.  (See the
       source code of dgetx for an example).  n = total size of the sequence.
       sect = size of sections of the sequence. sect must be a power of 2.
       cov has dimension sect. Calculation is performed by FFT.

  [1m"Updating method"
  [0m[w,xu]=corr('updt',x1,[y1],w0)
  [w,xu]=corr('updt',x2,[y2],w,xu)
   ...
  wk=corr('updt',xk,[yk],w,xu)
  With this calling sequence the calculation is updated at each call to corr.
  w0 = 0*ones(1,2*nlags);
  nlags = power of 2.
  x1,x2,... are parts of x such that x=[x1,x2,...] and sizes of xi a power of
  2.  To get nlags coefficients a final fft must be performed c=fft(w,1)/n;
  cov=c(1nlags) (n is the size of x (y)).  Caution: this calling sequence
  assumes that xmean = ymean = 0.
