rowinout(1)                    Scilab Function                    rowinout(1)






NAME
  rowinout - inner-outer factorization

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [Inn,X,Gbar]=rowinout(G)

PARAMETERS

  G     : linear system (syslin list) [A,B,C,D]

  Inn   :  inner factor (syslin list)

  Gbar  :  outer factor (syslin list)

  X     :  row-compressor of G (syslin list)

DESCRIPTION
  Inner-outer factorization (and row compression) of (lxp) G =[A,B,C,D] with
  l>=p.

  G is assumed to be tall (l>=p) without zero on the imaginary axis and with
  a D matrix which is full column rank.

  G must also be stable for having Gbar stable.

  G admits the following inner-outer factorization:
           G = [ Inn ] | Gbar |
                       |  0   |
  where Inn is square and inner (all pass and stable) and Gbar square and
  outer i.e: Gbar is square bi-proper and bi-stable (Gbar inverse is also
  proper and stable);

  Note that:
           [ Gbar ]
     X*G = [  -   ]
           [  0   ]
  is a row compression of G where X = Inn inverse is all-pass i.e:
   T
  X (-s) X(s) = Identity
  (for the continous time case).
