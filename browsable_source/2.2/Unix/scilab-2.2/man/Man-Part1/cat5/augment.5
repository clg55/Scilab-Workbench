augment(5)                     Scilab Function                     augment(5)






NAME
  augment - augmented plant

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [P,r]=augment(G,[flag])

PARAMETERS

  G    : linear system (syslin list), the nominal plant

  flag : one of the following (upper case) character string:
        'S' ,  'R' ,  'T'
        'SR' ,  'ST' ,  'RT'
        'SRT'

  P    : linear system (syslin list), the ``augmented'' plant

  r    : 1x2 row vector, dimension of P22 = G

DESCRIPTION
  If flag='SRT' (default value), returns the "full" augmented plant
      [ I | -G]   -->'S'
      [ 0 |  I]   -->'R'
  P = [ 0 |  G]   -->'T'
      [-------]
      [ I | -G]

   'S' ,  'R' ,  'T'  refer to the first three (block) rows of P respec-
  tively.

  If one of these letters is absent in flag, the corresponding row in P is
  missing.

  Note that weighting functions can be introduced by left-multipying P by a
  diagonal system of appropriate dimension, e.g.,
   P = sysdiag(W1,W2,W3,eye(G))*P.

  Sensitivity functions can be calculated by lft.
