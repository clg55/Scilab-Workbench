.SH NAME
"Scilab object: tlist" - typed list definition
.SH CALLING SEQUENCE
.nf
tlist(typ,a1,....an )  
.fi
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP 10
typ
: Character string or vector of character strings
.TP 
ai
: any Scilab object (\fVmatrix, list,string...\fR).
.SH DESCRIPTION
Creates a \fVtyped-list\fR with elements \fVai\fR's. The \fVtyp\fR
argument specifies the list type. Such \fVtyped-list\fR allow the user
to define new operations working on these object through scilab
functions. The only difference between \fVtyped-list\fR and \fVlist\fR
is the value of the type (16 instead of 15).
.LP
\fVtyp(1)\fR specifies the list type (character string used to define
soft coded operations)
.LP
if specified \fVtyp(i)\fR may give the \fVi+1\fRth element formal name
.LP
Standard Operations on \fVlist\fR work similarly for \fVtyped-list\fR: 
.IP extraction 
: \fV[x,y,z...]=l(v)\fR where \fVv\fR is a vector of indices; 
\fV[x,y,z]=l(:)\fR extracts all the elements.
.IP  insertion
: \fVl(i)=a\fR
.IP deletion
: \fVl(i)=null()\fR removes the i-th element of the \fVtlist l\fR.
.IP display
.LP
Moreover if \fVtyp(2:n+1)\fR are specified, user may point elements by
their names 

We give below examples where tlist are used.

Linear systems are represented by specific \fVtyped-list\fR e.g. a
linear system \fV[A,B,C,D]\fR is represented by the tlist
\fVSys=tlist(['lss';'A';'B';'C';'D';'X','dt']),A,B,C,D,x0,'c')\fR 
and this specific list may be created by the function \fVsyslin\fR.
.LP
Sys(2) or Sys('A') is the state-matrix 
.LP
A rational matrix \fVH\fR is represented by the \fVtyped-list\fR
\fVH=tlist(['r';'num';'den';'dt'],Num,Den)\fR where \fVNum\fR and \fVDen\fR are two
polynomial matrices and a  (e.g. continuous time) linear system with
transfer matrix \fVH\fR maybe created by \fVsyslin('c',H)\fR.
.LP
H(2) or H('num') is the transfer matrix numerator
