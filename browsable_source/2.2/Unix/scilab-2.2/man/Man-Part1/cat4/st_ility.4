st_ility(1)                    Scilab Function                    st_ility(1)






NAME
  st_ility - stabilizability test

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [ns, [nc, [,U [,Slo] ]]]=st_ility(Sl [,tol])

PARAMETERS

  Sl        : syslin list (linear system)

  ns        :  integer (dimension of stabilizable subspace)

  nc        :  integer (dimension of controllable subspace nc <= ns)

  U         : basis such that its ns (resp. nc) first components span the
            stabilizable (resp. controllable) subspace

  Slo       : a linear system (syslin list)

  tol       : threshold for controllability detection (see contr)

DESCRIPTION
   Slo=( U'*A*U, U'*B, C*U, D, U'*x0 ) (syslin list) displays the stabiliz-
  able form of Sl. Stabilizability means ns=nx (dim. of A matrix).
           [*,*,*]            [*]
  U'*A*U = [0,*,*]     U'*B = [0]
           [0,0,*]            [0]
  (where  (A11,B1)  is controllable and A22 is stable).  "Stable" means real
  part of eigenvalues negative for a continuous linear system, and magnitude
  of eigenvalues lower than one for a discrete-time system (as defined by
  syslin).
