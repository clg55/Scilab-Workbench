specfact(1)                    Scilab Function                    specfact(1)






NAME
  specfact - spectral factor

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [W0,L]=specfact(A,B,C,D)

DESCRIPTION
  Given a spectral density matrix phi(s):
                   -1                   -1
       R + C*(s*I-A) * B  +  B'*(-s*I-A') * C'  with R=D+D' > 0
  specfact computes  W0 and L such that  W(s)=W0+L*(s*I-A)^-1 * B  is a spec-
  tral factor of of PHI(s), i.e.

  PHI(s)=W'(-s)*W(s)
