rowregul(1)                    Scilab Function                    rowregul(1)






NAME
  rowregul - removing poles and zeros at infinity

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [Stmp,Ws]=rowregul(Sl,alfa,beta)

PARAMETERS

  Sl,Stmp        : syslin lists

  alfa,beta : reals (new pole and zero positions)

DESCRIPTION
  computes a postfilter Ws such that Stmp=Ws*Sl is proper and with full rank
  D matrix.

  Poles at infinity of Sl are moved to alfa;

  Zeros at infinity of Sl are moved to beta;

  Sl is a assumed to be a right invertible linear system (syslin list) in
  state-space representation with possibly a polynomial D matrix.

  This function is the dual of colregul (see function code).
