NAME
  ricc - Riccati equation

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [X]=ricc(A,B,C,"cont")
  [X]=ricc(F,G,H,"disc")

PARAMETERS

  A,B,C     : real matrices of appropriate dimensions

  F,G,H     : real matrices of appropriate dimensions

  X         : real matrix

  "cont","disc"' : imposed string (flag for continuous or discrete)

DESCRIPTION
  Riccati solver.

   [1mContinuous time
    [0mX=ricc(A,B,C,'cont')
  gives a solution to the continuous time ARE
    A'*X+X*A-X*B*X+C=0 .
  B and C are assumed to be nonnegative definite.  (A,G) is assumed to be
  stabilizable with G*G' a full rank factorization of B.

  (A,H) is assumed to be detectable with H*H' a full rank factorization of C.


   [1mDiscrete time
    [0mX=ricc(F,G,H,'disc')
  gives a solution  to the discrete time ARE
    X=F'*X*F-F'*X*G1*((G2+G1'*X*G1)^-1)*G1'*X*F+H
  F is assumed invertible and   G = G1*inv(G2)*G1'.

  One  assumes  (F,G1) stabilizable and (C,F) detectable with C'*C full rank
  factorization of H.
