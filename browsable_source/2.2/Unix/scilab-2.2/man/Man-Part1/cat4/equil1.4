equil1(1)                      Scilab Function                      equil1(1)






NAME
  equil1 - balancing (nonnegative) pair of matrices

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [T [,siz]]=equil1(P,Q [,tol])

PARAMETERS

  P, Q      : two non-negative symmetric matrices

  T         : nonsingular matrix

  siz       : vector of three integers

  tol       : threshold

DESCRIPTION
  equil1 computes t such that:

  P1=T*P*T'  and Q1=inv(T)'*Q*inv(T) are as follows:

  P1 = diag(S1,S2,0,0)  and Q1 = diag(S1,0,S3,0) with S1,S2,S3 positive and
  diagonal matrices with respective dimensions siz=[n1,n2,n3]

  tol is a threshold for rank determination in SVD
