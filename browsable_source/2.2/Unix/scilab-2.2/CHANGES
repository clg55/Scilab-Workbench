2.1 to 2.2 Major improvements
=============================
- New simulation tools
      * Scicos hybrid connected object simulator (Beta test version).

      * A discrete/continuous ode solver odedc has been added.

      * All ode solvers parameters are now available through %ODEOPTIONS
        variable and odeoptions function.

      * addition of DAE solver with root finder (dasrt).

- New version of Metanet

- New GUI utilities
      * Choice menu for xset parameters (see xset() ).

      * Menus to print/export graphics.

      * It is now possible to interactively zoom 2d plots and rotate 3d
        plots using the graphic window buttons.

      * Function to create and handle new buttons (see addmenu).

      * Function to get filenames (see xgetfile).

      * It is now possible to kill graphic windows using menu or xdel
        function.

- Optimization
      * New versions of optimization routines.

      * Non differentiable optimization added (optim('nd',...).

- Miscellaneous
      * scilab stack size may now be allocated at startup time and within
        scilab (see stacksize).

      * It is now possible to read and write data in integer format.

      * a new data type "typed-list" designed for "soft coded"
        operations (see tlist).

      * all the documentation of Scilab in Postscript compressed files 
        is no longer distributed with Scilab distribution. You will find 
        it by anonymous ftp on "ftp.inria.fr:/INRIA/Projects/Meta2/Scilab/doc"
        (internet# 192.93.2.54).

2.1 to 2.2 Incompatiblities
===========================
- Due to an initial inconsistency in  typed lists, a new data type 
  ("typed-list") has been created to handle new objects associated 
  with "soft coded" operations. The old way still works, but will be
  discarded in the next realease.

- x(:) extraction/insertion has been changed for string and polynomial 
  matrices do be coherent with the usual matrices.

- error message 48 split in 240 (read) et 241 (write)
  check errcatch(48,..) usage in macros

- an argument has been added to xsegs to set line style, It is no more
  possible to use xset('dashes',n);xsegs(..) to set line styles.

- Most of xset parameters are now attached to their particular window.

- plot3di, fac3di interactive functions have been replaced by plot3d
  and fac3d.

- Metanet has been fully revisited, many metanet related functions
  have been corrected and renamed.
