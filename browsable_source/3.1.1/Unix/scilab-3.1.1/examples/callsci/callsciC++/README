	How to make calls to Scilab interpreter 
	from a C++ program 
	
In this directory we provide small examples of C++ calls to the Scilab 
interpreter. 

[1] Unix ( soure are myprog.c and ccmatrix1.cc )
To make it run you have to edit the Makefile 
and change the SCIDIR variable to fit your local Scilab installation 

Then type 
	make distclean 
	make all 
	./myprog 

Note: The whole process should work under Windows but the Windows 
	Makefiles remain to be writen 

That's all 

[2] Windows (soure are myprog.c and ccmatrix1.cpp )

	to make it run you have to edit the Makefile.mak 
	and change the SCIDIR variable (and SCIDIR1) 
	to fit your local Scilab installation 

	Then type (I suppose that scilab home is c:\softs\scilab )
	nmake /f Makefile.mak 
	this will create  c:\softs\scilab\bin\prog.exe 
	
	You have to set SCI to the Scilab directory 
	set SCI=c:\softs\scilab 
	then run prog.exe in a console 
	to make the program run 

That's all
