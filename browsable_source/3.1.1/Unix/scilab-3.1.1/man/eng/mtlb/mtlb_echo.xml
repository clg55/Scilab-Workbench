  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="mtlb_echo">Matlab echo emulation function</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>

    <P>There is no equivalent for Matlab <VERB>echo</VERB> in Scilab but some cases can be replaced by calls to Scilab <VERB>mode</VERB>:</P>

    <P>
    The function <VERB>mtlb_echo(arg1[,arg2])</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>echo arg1 [arg2]</VERB> when it was not
    possible to know what were the inputs while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
    determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
    more efficient code it is possible to replace <VERB>mtlb_echo</VERB> calls:
    </P>
