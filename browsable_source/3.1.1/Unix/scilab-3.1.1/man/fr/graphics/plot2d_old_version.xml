          <SP>: This argument is used when the third character z of argument
          <VERB>strf</VERB> is 1. It is a row vector with four entries
          <VERB>[nx,Nx,ny,Ny]</VERB> where <VERB>nx</VERB> (<VERB>ny</VERB>)
          is the number of subgraduations on the x (y) axis and

        <PARAM_NAME>logflag</PARAM_NAME>

        <PARAM_DESCRIPTION>
          <SP>: a string formed by to characters h (for horizontal axis) and v
          (for vertical axis) each of these characters can take the values "n"
          or "l". "l" stands for logarithmic graduation and "n" for normal
          graduation. For example "ll"stands for a log-log plot. Default value
          is "nn".</SP>

  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P><VERB>plot2d</VERB> plots a set of 2D curves. Piecewise linear plotting
    is used.</P>

    <P>By default, successive plots are superposed. To clear the previous
    plot, use <VERB>xbasc()</VERB>.</P>

    <P>See the meaning of the parameters above for a complete description.</P>

    <P>Enter the command <VERB>plot2d()</VERB> to see a demo.</P>

    <P>Other high level plot2d function exist:</P>
