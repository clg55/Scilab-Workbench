  editor capacities</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>As explained in the <VERB>graphics_entities</VERB> help file, Scilab
    graphics is now based on a brent new graphics mode. This mode allows the
    user to have more interaction with graphics before and after having them
    drawn. In the <VERB>"new"</VERB> mode, each graphics window and the
    drawing it contains are represented by hierchical entities. The hierachy
    top level is the Figure. Each Figure defines at least one child of type
    Axes. Each Axes entity contains a set of leaf entities which are the basic
    graphics objects like Polylines, Rectangles, Arcs, Segs,... It can also
    contain an Agregation type which are recursive sets of entities.</P>

    <P>The main interest of the new graphic mode is to make property change
    easier. This new graphics'mode provides a set of high-level graphing
    routines (see <LINK>set</LINK>, <LINK>get</LINK>) used to control objects'
    properties such as data, coordinates and scaling, color and appearences
    without requiring to replay the initial graphics commands.</P>

    <P>Graphics entities are associated to Scilab variables of type
    <VERB>handle</VERB>. The handle is a unique identifier which is associated
    to each instance of a created graphical entity. Using this handle, it will
    be possible to reach entities' properties through "set" and "get"
    routines. The handles are also used to manipulate graphics objects, to
    move them, to make copies or delete them.</P>

    <P>To complete and use the graphics handle capacity at its maximum, a
    graphic object editor has been created too. It is a set of Tcl/Tk
    interfaces available for each kind of graphics objects (see
    <LINK>graphics_entities</LINK> for more details) that can be enabled for
    each graphic window. To make it work, select the <VERB>Edit</VERB> menu in
    the graphic window. Seven graphics editing operations are available :</P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="Select: ">
        <SP>Make the figure be the current one.</SP>

        <P></P>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="Redraw: ">
        <SP>Redraw the content of the graphics window (only useful for
        old_style mode).</SP>

        <P></P>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="Erase: ">
        <SP>Erase the content of the graphics window. Its action corresponds
        to a <VERB>xbasc</VERB> (old graphic style) or <VERB>clf</VERB> (new
        graphic style) command.</SP>

        <P></P>

        <P></P>

        <P>The last four items are specially dedicated to the graphic editor
        :</P>

        <P></P>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="Figure Properties: ">
        <SP>Launch the Tcl/Tk interface for the Figure object applied to the
        figure handle of the graphics window.</SP>

        <P></P>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="Current Axes Properties: ">
        <SP>Launch the Tcl/Tk interface for the Axes object applied to the
        current axes handle of the graphics window.</SP>

        <P></P>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="Start Entity Picker: ">
        <SP>Start an event handler on the graphics window to catch the mouse
        clicks on graphics objects and launch the corresponding Tcl/Tk
        interface.</SP>

        <P></P>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="Stop Entity Picker: ">
        <SP>Stop the action of the Entity Picker by terminating the event
        handler on the graphics window.</SP>

        <P></P>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    </DESCRIPTION_INDENT>

    <P>Once the graphic interface is enabled, two main areas appear :</P>

    <P></P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="A combobox entity selector: ">
        <SP>Placed in the right-top corner of the Tk interface, a combobox
        selector specifies which object is currently edited. It can be used to
        switch from a graphic object to another provided that they are in the
        same graphic window.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    </DESCRIPTION_INDENT>

    <P></P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="A notebook: ">
        <SP>The second area represents a notebook composed with different
        properties pages (like <VERB>Style</VERB>, <VERB>Data</VERB>,
        <VERB>Clipping</VERB>...) depending on the selected graphic object.
        Using this editor, man can edit more easily the whole properties set
        of each graphic object (like through the <VERB>"set"</VERB> and
        <VERB>"get"</VERB> commands).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    </DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
