.SH NAME
colregul - removing poles and zeros at infinity
.SH CALLING SEQUENCE
.nf
[Stmp,Ws]=colregul(Sl,alfa,beta) 
.fi
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP 15
Sl,Stmp
: \fVsyslin\fR lists
.TP 10
alfa,beta
: reals (new pole and zero positions)
.SH DESCRIPTION
computes a prefilter \fVWs\fR such that \fVStmp=Sl*Ws\fR is proper and 
with full rank \fVD\fR matrix.
.LP
Poles at infinity of \fVSl\fR are moved to \fValfa\fR;
.LP
Zeros at infinity of \fVSl\fR are moved to \fVbeta\fR;
.LP
\fVSl\fR is a assumed to be a left invertible linear system (\fVsyslin\fR list)
in state-space representation with possibly a polynomial \fVD\fR matrix.
