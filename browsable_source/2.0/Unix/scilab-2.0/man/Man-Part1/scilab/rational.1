.SH NAME
"Scilab object : rationals" - rational in Scilab
.SH DESCRIPTION
A rational \fVr\fR is a quotient of two polynomials \fVr=num/den\fR.
The internal representation of a rational is a list.
\fVr=list('r',num,den,[])\fR is the same as \fVr=num/den\fR.
A rational matrix can be defined with the usual syntax
e.g. \fV[r11,r12;r21,r22]\fR is a 2x2 matrix where \fVrij\fR are 
1x1 rationals.
A rational matrix can also be defined as above as a list
\fVlist('r',num,den,[])\fR with \fVnum\fR and \fVden\fR polynomial matrices.
