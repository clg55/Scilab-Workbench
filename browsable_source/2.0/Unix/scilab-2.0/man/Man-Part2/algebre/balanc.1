.SH PARAMETERS
.TP 10
A:
a real square matrix
.TP
X:
a real square invertible matrix
.TP
E:
a real square matrix (same dimension as \fVA\fR)
.TP
Y:
a real square invertible matrix.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Balance a square matrix to improve its condition number.
.LP
.Vb [Ab,X] = balanc(A) 
finds a similarity transformation \fVX\fR such that
.Vb Ab = inv(X)*A*X 
has approximately equal row and column norms.
.LP
For matrix pencils,balancing is done for improving the
generalized eigenvalue problem.
.LP
.Vb [Eb,Ab,X,Y] = balanc(E,A)
returns left and right transformations \fVX\fR and \fVY\fR
such that
.Vb Eb=X*E*Y      Ab=X*A*Y
.SH Remark
Balancing is made in the functions \fVbdiag\fR and \fVspec\fR.
