The purpose of this contribution is to emulate the Matlab mexfile
mechanism for people too lazy/busy to learn the Scilab dynamic
link interfacing mechanism...

Only the most useful functions have been emulated. 

See SCIDIR/routines/default/mexlib.c for additional info and
in particular the list of emulated mx functions.
