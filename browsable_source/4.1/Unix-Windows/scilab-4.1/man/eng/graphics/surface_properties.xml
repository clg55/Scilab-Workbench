  properties</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>The Surface entity is a leaf of the graphics entities hierarchy. Two
    classes appears under this type of entity : <VERB>Plot3d</VERB> and
    <VERB>Fac3d</VERB> according to the ploting function or the way data is
    entered. <VERB>Fac3d</VERB> and <VERB>Plo3d</VERB> entities are similar
    but <VERB>Fac3d</VERB> is more complete and accept more options than
    <VERB>Plot3d</VERB>. To always have <VERB>Fac3d</VERB> entities, simply
    use <VERB>genfac3d</VERB> to pre-build matrices before using
    <VERB>plot3d</VERB> or use the <VERB>surf</VERB> command.</P>

    <P>Here are the properties contained in a surface entity:</P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="parent: ">
        <SP>This property contains the handle of the parent. The parent of the
        surface entity should be of type <VERB>"Axes"</VERB> or
        <VERB>"Compound"</VERB>.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="children: ">
        <SP>This property contains a vector with the <VERB>children</VERB> of
        the handle. However, surface handles currently do not have any
        <VERB>children</VERB>.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="visible: ">
        <SP>This field contains the <VERB>visible</VERB> property value for
        the entity . It should be <VERB>"on" </VERB> or <VERB>"off"</VERB> .
        By default, surfaces are visibles, the value's property is
        <VERB>"on"</VERB>. If <VERB>"off"</VERB> the 3D graphics are not
        displayed on the screen.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="surface_mode: ">
        <SP>This field contains the default <VERB>surface_mode</VERB> property
        value for the surface. Its value should be <VERB>"on" </VERB>(surface
        drawn) or <VERB>"off"</VERB> (no surface drawn).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="foreground: ">
        <SP>If <VERB>color_mode &gt;= 0</VERB>, this field contains the color
        index used to draw the edges. If not, foreground is not used at all.
        The foreground value should be an integer color index (relative to the
        current colormap).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="thickness: ">
        <SP>This field contains the default <VERB>thickness</VERB> value of
        the lines used to draw the facets contours. It should be a positive
        integer.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_mode: ">
        <SP>This field contains the default <VERB>mark_mode</VERB> property
        value for the surface. Its value should be <VERB>"on"</VERB> (marks
        drawn) or <VERB>"off"</VERB> (no marks drawn).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_style: ">
        <SP>The <VERB>mark_style</VERB> property value is used to select the
        type of mark to use when <VERB>mark_mode</VERB> property is
        <VERB>"on"</VERB>. The value should be an integer in [0 14] which
        stands for: dot, plus, cross, star, filled diamond, diamond, triangle
        up, triangle down, diamond plus, circle, asterisk, square, triangle
        right, triangle left and pentagram.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_size_unit: ">
        <SP>This field contains the default <VERB>mark_size_unit</VERB>
        property value. If <VERB>mark_size_unit</VERB> is set to
        <VERB>"point"</VERB>, then the <VERB>mark_size</VERB> value is
        directly given in points. When <VERB>mark_size_unit</VERB> is set to
        <VERB>"tabulated"</VERB>, <VERB>mark_size</VERB> is computed relative
        to the font size array: therefore, its value should be an integer in
        [0 5] whith stands for 8pt, 10pt, 12pt, 14pt, 18pt and 24pt. Note that
        <LINK>plot3d</LINK> and pure scilab functions use
        <VERB>tabulated</VERB> mode as default ; when using the
        <LINK>surf</LINK> (or <LINK>plot</LINK> for 2D lines) function, the
        <VERB>point</VERB> mode is automatically enabled.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_size: ">
        <SP>The <VERB>mark_size</VERB> property is used to select the type of
        size of the marks when <VERB>mark_mode</VERB> property is
        <VERB>"on"</VERB>. Its value should be an integer between 0 and 5
        whith stands for 8pt, 10pt, 12pt, 14pt, 18pt and 24pt.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_foreground: ">
        <SP>This field contains the <VERB>mark_foreground</VERB> property
        value which is the marks' edge color. Its value should be a color
        index (relative to the current color_map).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_background: ">
        <SP>This field contains the <VERB>mark_background</VERB> property
        value which is the marks' face color. Its value should be a color
        index (relative to the current color_map).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="data: ">
        <SP>This field defines a <VERB>tlist</VERB> data structure of type
        "3d" composed of a row and column indices of each element as the x-,
        y- and z-coordinates contained respectivly in
        <VERB>data.x</VERB>,<VERB>data.y</VERB> and <VERB>data.z</VERB>. The
        complementary field named <VERB>data.color</VERB> is available in case
        a real color vector or matrix is specified. If none,
        <VERB>data.color</VERB> is not listed. The surface is painted
        according to <VERB>color_mode </VERB>and <VERB>color_flag</VERB>
        properties. </SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="color_mode: ">
        <SP>an integer between <VERB>[-size(colormap) ; size(colormap)]</VERB>
        defining the color of the facet when <VERB>color_flag</VERB> value is
        <VERB>0</VERB>. As stated before, if<VERB> color_mode &gt; 0</VERB>,
        edges are drawn using <VERB>foreground</VERB> color. If
        <VERB>color_mode</VERB> is set to <VERB>0</VERB>, a mesh of the
        surface is drawn: front faces have no colors. Finally, when
        <VERB>color_mode &lt; 0</VERB>, front faces are painted with color
        <VERB>-color_mode</VERB> but no edges are displayed.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="color_flag: ">
        <SP>This field is used to specify the algorithm used to set facets'
        colors.</SP>

        <SP>Not that the rules on <VERB>color_mode</VERB>,
        <VERB>foreground</VERB> and <VERB>hiddencolor</VERB> are still applied
        to this case.</SP>

                value is painted using the index 1 color while the maximum
                <VERB>z</VERB> value is painted using highest color index. The

            Then, the <VERB>data.color</VERB> value is used to set colors for
            facets (indices in the current colormap) if it exists. If not, the

                <P>Facets painting results of interpolation of vertices

                defining the facet's boundary.</P>

                <P><VERB>data.color</VERB> contains a color matrix of size
