    <DESCRIPTION>
      <SP>
      This page describes the the most important values returned in the
      optional lhs <LINK>ode</LINK> function arguments <VERB>w</VERB> and
      <VERB>iw</VERB>.
      These are valid only for the <VERB>lsode</VERB> 
      <VERB>lsoda</VERB> and  <VERB>lsodar</VERB> ode solver.
	For more details, one can look at the solvers fortran code comments in <VERB>routines/integ/lsod*.f</VERB>.
