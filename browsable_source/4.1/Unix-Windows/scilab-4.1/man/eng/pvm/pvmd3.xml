  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>
    pvmd3 is a daemon process which coordinates hosts in a virtual
    machine. One pvmd must run on each host in the group. They provide
    the communication and process control functions needed by the user's
    PVM processes. The daemon can be started manually with a host file
    argument that will automatically start the remote pvmds. The local and
    remote pvmds can also be started from the PVM console program pvm.
  </P>
    <P>
    The name of the daemon executable is pvmd3. It is usually started by a
    shell script, <VERB>$PVM_ROOT/lib/pvmd</VERB>.
  </P>
    <P>
    Local daemon may also be started by the scilab instruction <VERB>pvm_start()</VERB>
    and remote daemons may also be started by the scilab function 
    pvm_addhosts

    <P>
    This specifies the names of five hosts to be configured in the virtual machine.  The master pvmd for a group is started by hand on the localhost, and it starts slaves on each of the remaining hosts using the rsh or rexec command. The master host may appear on any line of the hostfile, but must have an entry.  The simple format above works fine if you have the same login name on all five machines and the name of the master host in your .rhosts files on the other four.  There are several host file options available:

The startup will then continue as normal.</SP>

      <ITEM label="dx=FILE">
        <SP>Specifies the path of the pvmd executable. FILE may be a simple filename, an absolute pathname, or a path relative to the user's home directory on the remote host. This is mainly useful to aid in debugging new versions of PVM, but may have other uses.</SP>

     A dollar sign ( <VERB>$</VERB> ) in an option introduces a variable name, for example <VERB>$PVM_ARCH</VERB>. Names are expanded from environment variables by each pvmd.  Each of the flags above has a default value. These are:

    You can change these by adding a line with a star ( * ) in the first field followed by the options, for example:

        <SP>This sets new default values for `lo' and `so' for the remainder of the host file, or until the next `*' line. Options set on the last `*' line also apply to hosts added dynamically using pvm_addhosts().</SP>
      </ITEM>
    </ITEMIZE>
    <P>
    Host options can be set without starting the hosts automatically. Information on host file lines beginning with `&amp;' is stored, but the hosts are not started until added using pvm_addhosts().

  </SECTION>
  <SECTION label="Stopping PVMD3">
    <P>
     The preferred method of stopping all the pvmds is to give the halt command in the PVM console.  This kills all pvm tasks, all the remote daemons, the local daemon, and finally the console itself. If the master pvmd is killed manually it should be sent a SIGTERM signal to allow it to kill the remote pvmds and clean up various files.  The pvmd can be killed in a manner that leaves the file /tmp/pvmd.uid behind on one or more hosts. Uid is the numeric user ID (from /etc/passwd) of the user. This will prevent PVM from restarting on that host. Deletion of this file will fix this problem:</P>
