  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="mtlb_plot">Matlab plot emulation function</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>

    <P>Matlab <VERB>plot</VERB> and Scilab <VERB>plot2d</VERB> behave differently.</P>

    <P>
    The function <VERB>mtlb_plot(varargin)</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>plot(varargin)</VERB> when it was not
    possible to know what were the inputs while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
    determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
    more efficient code it is possible to replace <VERB>mtlb_plot</VERB> calls when there is no output value,
    however in this case, you have to set colors manualy:

        With one input, if <VERB>Y</VERB> is real,
        <VERB>mtlb_plot(Y)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>plot2d(Y)</VERB>

        With one input, if <VERB>Y</VERB> is complex,
        <VERB>mtlb_plot(Y)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>plot2d(real(Y),imag(Y))</VERB>

        With two inputs <VERB>X</VERB> and <VERB>Y</VERB>, if <VERB>Y</VERB> is not a character string,
