  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="mtlb_imp">Matlab colon emulation function</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>

    <P>Matlab and Scilab colon behave differently in some particular cases:</P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
    <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    <ITEMIZE>
      <ITEM>
        <SP>
	With empty matrices: The <VERB>:</VERB> operator must be used with scalars in Scilab and  
	gives an error message when used with empty matrices while Matlab returns [] in these cases.
	</SP>

    </DESCRIPTION_INDENT>

    <P>    
    The function <VERB>mtlb_imp(A,B[,C])</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>A:B[:C]</VERB> when it was not
    possible to know what were the operands while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
    determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
    more efficient code it is possible to replace <VERB>mtlb_imp</VERB> calls:

        <SP>    
	If <VERB>A</VERB>, <VERB>B</VERB> and <VERB>C</VERB> are not empty matrices
	<VERB>mtlb_imp(A,B[,C])</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>A:B[:C]</VERB>
	</SP>
