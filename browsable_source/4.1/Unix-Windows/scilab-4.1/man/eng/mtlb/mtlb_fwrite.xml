  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="mtlb_fwrite">Matlab fwrite emulation function</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>

    <P>There is no Scilab equivalent for Matlab <VERB>fwrite</VERB>. Scilab <VERB>mput</VERB>
    and Matlab <VERB>fwrite</VERB> behave differently in many cases, but they are equivalents in some cases.</P>

    <P>
    The function <VERB>mtlb_fwrite(varargin)</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>fwrite</VERB>. This function will
    determine the correct semantic at run time. It is sometimes possible to replace
    calls to <VERB>mtlb_fwrite</VERB> by calls to <LINK>mput</LINK>.
    </P>

    <P>Caution: <VERB>mtlb_fwrite</VERB> has not to be used for hand coded functions.</P>
