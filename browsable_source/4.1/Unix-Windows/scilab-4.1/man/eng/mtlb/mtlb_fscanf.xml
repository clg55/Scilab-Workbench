  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="mtlb_fscanf">Matlab fscanf emulation function</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>

    <P>There is no Scilab exact equivalent for Matlab <VERB>fscanf</VERB>. Scilab <VERB>mfscanf</VERB>
    and Matlab <VERB>fscanf</VERB> behave differently in many cases, but they are equivalents in some cases.</P>

    <P>
    The function <VERB>mtlb_fscanf(varargin)</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>fscanf</VERB>. This function will
    determine the correct semantic at run time. It is sometimes possible to replace
    calls to <VERB>mtlb_fscanf</VERB> by calls to <LINK>mfscanf</LINK>.
    </P>

    <P>Caution: <VERB>mtlb_fscanf</VERB> has not to be used for hand coded functions.</P>
