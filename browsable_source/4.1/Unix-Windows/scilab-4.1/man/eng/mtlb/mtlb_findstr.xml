  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="mtlb_findstr">Matlab findstr emulation function</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>

    <P>There is no Scilab equivalent for Matlab <VERB>findstr</VERB>.</P>

    <P>
    The function <VERB>mtlb_findstr(A,B)</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>findstr(A,B)</VERB> when it was not
    possible to know what were the operands/inputs[CUSTOM] while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
    determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
    more efficient code it is possible to replace <VERB>mtlb_findstr</VERB> calls:
    </P>

        If <VERB>A</VERB> is always longer than <VERB>B</VERB>
	(i.e. <VERB>findstr</VERB> can be replaced by <VERB>strfind</VERB> in Matlab,
        <VERB>mtlb_findstr(A,B)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>strindex(A,B)</VERB>
