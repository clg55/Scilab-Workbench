  <DESCRIPTION>

    <P>Matlab and Scilab <VERB>linspace</VERB> behave differently in some particular cases:</P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
    <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    <ITEMIZE>
      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        With character string inputs: Matlab <VERB>linspace(A,B[,n])</VERB> returns a character string vector if <VERB>A</VERB>
	and/or <VERB>B</VERB> are character strings, but Scilab function does not work with such inputs.
        </SP>
      </ITEM>
    </ITEMIZE>
    </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    </DESCRIPTION_INDENT>

    <P>
    The function <VERB>mtlb_linspace(A,B[,n])</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>linspace(A,B[,n])</VERB> when it was not
    possible to know what were the inputs while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
    determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
    more efficient code it is possible to replace <VERB>mtlb_linspace</VERB> calls:
    </P>

      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        If <VERB>A</VERB> and <VERB>B</VERB> are not character strings
        <VERB>mtlb_linspace(A,B[,n])</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>linspace(A,B[,n])</VERB>
        </SP>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        If <VERB>A</VERB> or <VERB>B</VERB> are character strings
        <VERB>mtlb_linspace(A,B[,n])</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>ascii(linspace(ascii(A),ascii(B)[,n]))</VERB>
         </SP>
      </ITEM>

    <P>Caution: <VERB>mtlb_linspace</VERB> has not to be used for hand coded functions.</P>
