  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="mtlb_fliplr">Matlab fliplr emulation function</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>

    <P>Matlab and Scilab <VERB>fliplr</VERB> behave differently in some particular cases:</P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
    <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    <ITEMIZE>
      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        With character string matrices: due to te fact that Scilab and Matlab do not consider character string matrices in the same way, result can be different for input of this type.
        </SP>

    </DESCRIPTION_INDENT>

    <P>
    The function <VERB>mtlb_fliplr(A)</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>fliplr(A)</VERB> when it was not
    possible to know what were the inputs while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
    determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
    more efficient code it is possible to replace <VERB>mtlb_fliplr</VERB> calls:
    </P>

        <SP>
        If <VERB>A</VERB> is not a character string matrix,
        <VERB>mtlb_fliplr(A)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>A(:,$:-1:1)</VERB>
