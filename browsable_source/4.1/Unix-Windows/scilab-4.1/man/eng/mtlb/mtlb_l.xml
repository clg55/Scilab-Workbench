  <DESCRIPTION>
    
    <P>Matlab and Scilab left division behave differently in some particular cases:</P>

        <SP>    
	With character string operands: The <VERB>\</VERB> 
	operator can not be used into Scilab with character strings, while
	in Matlab it can. And in this case, result is transposed in a very strange way...

    <P>
    The function <VERB>mtlb_l(A,B)</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>A\B</VERB> when it was not
    possible to know what were the operands while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
    determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
    more efficient code it is possible to replace <VERB>mtlb_l</VERB> calls:
    </P>

	<VERB>mtlb_l(A,B)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>A\B</VERB>.
