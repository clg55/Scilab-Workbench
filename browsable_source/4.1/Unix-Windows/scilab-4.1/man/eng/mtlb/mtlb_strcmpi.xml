  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="mtlb_strcmpi">Matlab strcmpi emulation function</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>

    <P>There is no Scilab function equivalent for Matlab <VERB>strcmpi</VERB>, there is equivalent instructions.</P>

    <P>
    The function <VERB>mtlb_strcmpi(A,B)</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>strcmpi(A,B)</VERB> when it was not
    possible to know what were the inputs while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
    determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
    more efficient code it is possible to replace <VERB>mtlb_strcmpi</VERB> calls:
    </P>
