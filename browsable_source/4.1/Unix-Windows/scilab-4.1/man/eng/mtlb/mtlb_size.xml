  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="mtlb_size">Matlab size emulation function</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>

    <P>Matlab and Scilab <VERB>size</VERB> behave differently in some particular cases:</P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
    <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    <ITEMIZE>
      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        With two inputs: Matlab <VERB>size</VERB> can be used with second parameter giving
	a not-existing dimension of first parameter (returns 1 in this case) but not Scilab one.
        </SP>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        With more than one output: if number of output is lesser than number of dimensions,
	last output is the product of all remaining dimensions in Matlab but not in Scilab.
	If number of output is greater than number of dimensions, outputs corresponding to a
	not-existing dimension are set to 1 in Matlab but Scilab gives an error in this case.
        </SP>

    <P>
    The function <VERB>[d1,[d2,...]] = mtlb_size(X[,dim])</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>[d1,[d2,...]] = size(X[,dim])</VERB> when it was not
    possible to know what were the inputs while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
    determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
    more efficient code it is possible to replace <VERB>mtlb_size</VERB> calls:

        With two inputs: if <VERB>dim</VERB> gives an existing dimension of <VERB>X</VERB>
        <VERB>mtlb_size(X,dim)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>size(X,dim)</VERB>

        With more than one outputs: if the number of outputs is equal to the number of dimensions of <VERB>X</VERB>
        <VERB>[d1,[d2,...]] = mtlb_size(X)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>[d1,[d2,...]] = size(X)</VERB>
