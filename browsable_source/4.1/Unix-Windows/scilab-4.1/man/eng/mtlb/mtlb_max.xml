  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="mtlb_max">Matlab max emulation function</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>

    <P>Matlab and Scilab <VERB>max</VERB> behave differently in some particular cases:</P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
    <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    <ITEMIZE>
      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        With complex values: Matlab <VERB>max</VERB> can be used with complex values but not Scilab function.
        </SP>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        When called with one input: Matlab <VERB>max</VERB> threats values along the first
	non-singleton dimension but Scilab threats all input values.
        </SP>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        When called with two inputs: if one is an empty matrix, Scilab returns an error message but Matlab returns [].
        </SP>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        When called with three inputs: if <VERB>dim</VERB> parameter is greater than number of
	dimensions of first input, Scilab returns an error message and Matlab returns the first input.
        </SP>

    <P>
    The function <VERB>[r[,k]] = mtlb_max(A[,B[,dim]])</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>[r[,k]] = max(A[,B[,dim]])</VERB> when it was not
    possible to know what were the inputs while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
    determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
    more efficient code it is possible to replace <VERB>mtlb_max</VERB> calls:
