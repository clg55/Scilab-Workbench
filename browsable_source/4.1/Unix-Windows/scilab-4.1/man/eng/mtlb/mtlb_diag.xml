  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="mtlb_diag">Matlab diag emulation function</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>

    <P>Matlab and Scilab <VERB>diag</VERB> behave differently in some particular cases:</P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
    <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    <ITEMIZE>
      <ITEM>
        <SP>    
	With character string matrices: Scilab <VERB>diag</VERB> function considers each character string as an object
	while Matlab considers each character individually.
        </SP>    
      </ITEM>
    </ITEMIZE>
    </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    </DESCRIPTION_INDENT>

    <P>
    The function <VERB>y = mtlb_diag(x[,dim])</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>y = diag(x[,dim])</VERB> when it was not
    possible to know what were the inputs while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
    determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
    more efficient code it is possible to replace <VERB>mtlb_diag</VERB> calls:
    </P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
    <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    <ITEMIZE>
      <ITEM>
        <SP>    
	If <VERB>x</VERB> is not a character string matrix
	<VERB>y = mtlb_diag(x[,dim])</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>y = diag(x[,dim])</VERB>
        </SP>    
      </ITEM>
    </ITEMIZE>
    </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    </DESCRIPTION_INDENT>

    <P>Caution: <VERB>mtlb_diag</VERB> has not to be used for hand coded functions.</P>
