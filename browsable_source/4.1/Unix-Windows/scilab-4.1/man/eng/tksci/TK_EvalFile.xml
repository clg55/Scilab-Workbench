  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>With this routine, one can read and evaluate the content of a file
    containing tcl/tk scripts. This allows to create powerful tk
    interfaces.</P>

    <P>The filename might be relative or absolute.</P>
  </DESCRIPTION>

  <SECTION label="Advantages and drawbacks of this functionality">
    <P>This routines allows to use directly tcl/tk scripts. This thus allows,
    for instance to use Interface Builders such as SpecTcl to design the
    interface. The interfaces built directly with tcl/tk scripts are much
    faster than the ones built with the Scilab Graphic Object library provided
    with tksci (see uicontrol for example). Indeed, those Objects are warpings
    around tk graphic widgets. Nevertheless, this way of creating graphic user
    interface should only be used when one aims at addressing directly
    specific tk/tcl features. There are two main reasons for this. First of
    all, there is no simple way to manipulate Scilab objects from within a
    tcl/tk script. Thus, the interface designer has to write two sets of
    callbacks routines. One to describe the changes occuring in the interface
    when the user acts on the widgets. The second set of call routines will
    perform the (pure) Scilab reactions to the user actions.</P>

    <P>Here is an example: Suppose you design a scrollbar corresponding to a
    spline tension value. You want the spline to be displayed in a graphic
    windows and updated each time the user moves the scrollbar. At the same
    time, you want the value of this tension parameter to be displayed within
    the Interface. You will have to write a first tcl/tk (callback) function
    which will be automatically called by the tk scrollbar ("-command"
    option). This callback function will update the displayed value of the
    parameter in the interface and will then call the scilab routine
    ("ScilabEval" command) to update the graph.</P>
  </SECTION>

  <SECTION label="Remarks on the tcl/tk script style">
    <P>Because Scilab manages the tcl/tk events, it creates the root window
    ".", this window should not be destroyed nor directly used by your tcl/tk
    scripts. You should thus always create your own toplevel windows.
    Moreover, since this module was written at a time when namespaces didn't
    exist, some variables defined by scilab tcl/tk scripts could collide your
    code. Running your scripts in a slave interpreter may help in such a
    case.</P>
