  <DESCRIPTION>

    <P>Matlab and Scilab <VERB>double</VERB> behave differently in some particular cases:</P>

    <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    <ITEMIZE>
      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        With character string input: Scilab <VERB>double</VERB> does not work with this type of input while Matlab <VERB>double</VERB> returns a matrix of ASCII codes.
        </SP>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        With boolean input: Scilab <VERB>double</VERB> does not work with this type of input while Matlab <VERB>double</VERB> returns a matrix of double values.

    <P>
    The function <VERB>mtlb_double(A)</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>double(A)</VERB> when it was not
    possible to know what were theinput while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
    determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
    more efficient code it is possible to replace <VERB>mtlb_double</VERB> calls:
    </P>
