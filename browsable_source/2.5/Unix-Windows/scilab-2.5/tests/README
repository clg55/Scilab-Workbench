This directory contains evaluation programs for testing Scilab's
installation on your machine.

1- to run a global test on various functions type "make tests"
   in this directory. Results of the tests are compared to 
   corresponding references. Failure of a test does not necessarily
   imply bad installation. Failure may be due to small differences
   in machine constants. This can happen in particular in "matopt.tst".

2- to run test on a specific item, invoke Scilab in this directory
   and  type "exec('<item>.tst')" at Scilab prompt.
   or type 
	make <name>.dia to run test on name 
	ex : rm calelm.dia 
	make calelm.dia 

3- NT/WinXX with MSVC++ : Makefile.mak is not set up for testing Scilab 
   	thus if you use nmake you must test each test file as pointed in 2.

   	Anyway, you can run all the tests with make if you have cygwin tools. 
	Edit Makefile and replace scidem by scidem-gcwin32 
	then run <<make tests>> to make all the test for your MSVC++ compiled 
	scilab
