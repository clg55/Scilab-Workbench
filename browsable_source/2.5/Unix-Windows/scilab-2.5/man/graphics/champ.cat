champ(2)                       Scilab Function                       champ(2)
NAME
  champ - 2D vector field plot

CALLING SEQUENCE
  champ(x,y,fx,fy,[arfact,rect,strf])

PARAMETERS

  x,y     : two vectors which define the grid.

  fx      : a matrix which describes the x component of the vector field.
          fx(i,j) is the x component of the vector field at point
          (x(i),y(j)).

  fy      : a matrix which describes the y component of the vector field.
          fy(i,j) is the y component of the vector field at point
          (x(i),y(j)).

  arfact  : an optional argument of type real which gives a scale factor for
          the display of the arrow heads on the plot (default value is 1.0).

  rect    : a vector rect=[xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax] which gives the boundaries of
          the graphics frame to use.

  strf    : a string of length 3 "xyz" which has the same meaning as the strf
          parameter of plot2d. The first character x has no effect with
          champ.

DESCRIPTION
  champ draws a 2D vector field. The length of the arrows is proportional to
  the intensity of the field.

  If you want colored arrows with the color of the arrows depending on the
  intensity of the field, use champ1.

  Enter the command champ() to see a demo.

EXAMPLE
  // using rect as plot boundaries
  champ(-5:5,-5:5,rand(11,11),rand(11,11),1,[-10,-10,10,10],"011")
  // using (x,y) to get boundaries
  xbasc()
  champ(-5:5,-5:5,rand(11,11),rand(11,11),2,[-10,-10,10,10],"021")
