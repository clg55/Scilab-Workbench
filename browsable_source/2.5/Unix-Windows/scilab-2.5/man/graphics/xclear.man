.SH DESCRIPTION
Without any argument, this function clears the current window.
Otherwise it clears the graphics windows whose numbers are included 
in the vector \fVwindow-id\fR. For example \fVxclear(1:3)\fR clears windows
1, 2 and 3.
If one of the windows does not 
exist, then it is automatically created.
.LP
Warning: in recording mode \fVxclear\fR clears
the window, but it does not erase the recorded commands.
In this case you must use the function \fVxbasc\fR.
