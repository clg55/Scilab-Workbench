NAME
  hist3d - 3D representation of a histogram

CALLING SEQUENCE
  hist3d(f,[theta,alpha,leg,flag,ebox])
  hist3d(list(f,x,y),[theta,alpha,leg,flag,ebox])

PARAMETERS

  f            : matrix of size (m,n) defining the histogram
               f(i,j)=F(x(i),y(j)), where x and y  are taken as 0:m and 0:n.

  list(f,x,y)  : where f is a matrix of size (m,n)defining the histogram
               f(i,j)=F(x(i),y(j)), with x and y vectors of size (1,n+1) and
               (1,m+1).

  theta,alpha,leg,flag,ebox
               : see plot3d.

DESCRIPTION
  hist3d represents a 2d histogram as a 3D plot.  The values are associated
  to the intervals [x(i) x(i+1)[ X [y(i) y(i+1)[.
