NAME
  xbasc - clear a graphics window and erase the associated recorded graphics

CALLING SEQUENCE
  xbasc([window-id])

PARAMETERS

  window-id : integer scalar or vector

DESCRIPTION
  Without any argument, this function clears the current graphics window and
  erases the recorded graphics.  Otherwise it clears the graphics windows
  whose numbers are included in the vector window-id, and erases the corre-
  sponding recorded graphics. For example xbasc(1:3) clears windows 1, 2 and
  3 and erases the corresponding recorded graphics. If one of the windows
  does not exist, then it is automatically created.
