NAME
  locate - mouse selection of a set of points

CALLING SEQUENCE
  x=locate([n,flag])

PARAMETERS

  x       : matrix of size (2,n1). n1=n if the parameter n is given.

  n,flag  : integer values.

DESCRIPTION
  locate is used to get the coordinates of one or more points selected with
  the mouse in a graphics window. The coordinates are given using the current
  graphics scale.

  If n>0, n points are selected and their coordinates are returned in the
  matrix x.

  If n<=0, points are selected until the user clicks with the left button of
  the mouse which stands for stop. The last point (clicked with the left but-
  ton) is not returned.

  x=locate() is the same as x=locate(-1).

  If flag=1 a cross is drawn at the points where the mouse is clicked.
