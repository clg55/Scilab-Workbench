NAME
  Sgrayplot - smooth 2D plot of a surface using colors

CALLING SEQUENCE
  Sgrayplot(x,y,z,[strf,rect,nax])

DESCRIPTION
  Sgrayplot is the same as grayplot but the plot is smoothed.  The function
  fec is used for smoothing.  The surface is plotted assuming that it is lin-
  ear on a set of triangles built from the grid:
      ______
      | /| /|
      |/_|/_|
      | /| /|
      |/_|/_|

  Enter the command Sgrayplot() to see a demo.

EXAMPLE
  x=-10:10; y=-10:10;m =rand(21,21);
  Sgrayplot(x,y,m,"111",[-20,-20,20,20])
  t=-%pi:0.1:%pi; m=sin(t)'*cos(t);
  xbasc()
  Sgrayplot(t,t,m)
