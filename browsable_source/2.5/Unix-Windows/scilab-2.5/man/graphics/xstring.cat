xstring(2)                     Scilab Function                     xstring(2)
NAME
  xstring - draw strings

CALLING SEQUENCE
  xstring(x,y,str,[angle,box])

PARAMETERS

  x,y    : real scalars, coordinates of the lower-left point of the strings.

  str    : matrix of strings.

  angle  : real, clockwise angle in degree; default is 0.

  box    : integer, default is 0.

DESCRIPTION
  xstring draws the matrix of strings str at location x,y (lower-left point)
  in the current graphic scale: each row of the matrix stands for a line of
  text and row elements stand for words separated by a white space.  If angle
  is given, it gives the slope in degree used for drawing the strings. If box
  is 1 and angle is 0, a box is drawn around the strings.

EXAMPLE
  plot2d([0;1],[0;1],0)
  xstring(0.5,0.5,["Scilab" "is"; "not" "esilaB"])
  //Other example
  alphabet=["a" "b" "c" "d" "e" "f" "g" ..
            "h" "i" "j" "k" "l" "m" "n" ..
            "o" "p" "q" "r" "s" "t" "u" ..
            "v" "w" "x" "y" "z"];
  xbasc()
  plot2d([0;1],[0;2],0)
  xstring(0.1,1.8,alphabet)     // alphabet
  xstring(0.1,1.6,alphabet,0,1) // alphabet in a box
  xstring(0.1,1.4,alphabet,20)  // angle
  xset("font",1,1)              // use symbol fonts
  xstring(0.1,0.1,alphabet)
  xset("font",1,3)              // change size font
  xstring(0.1,0.3,alphabet)
  xset("font",1,24); xstring(0.1,0.6,"a") //big alpha
  xset("default")
