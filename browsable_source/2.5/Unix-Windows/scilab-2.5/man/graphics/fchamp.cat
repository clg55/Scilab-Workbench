NAME
  fchamp - direction field of a 2D first order ODE

CALLING SEQUENCE
  fchamp(f,t,xr,yr,[arfact,rect,strf])

PARAMETERS

  f      : An external (function or character string) or a list which
         describes the ODE.

         -  It can be a function name f, where f is supposed to be a function
            of type y=f(t,x,[u]).  f returns a column vector of size 2, y,
            which gives the value of the direction field f at point x and at
            time t.

         -  It can also be an object of type list, list(f,u1) where f is a
            function of type y=f(t,x,u) and u1 gives the value of the parame-
            ter u.

  t      : The selected time.

  xr,yr  : Two row vectors of size n1 and n2 which define the grid on which
         the direction field is computed.

  arfact,rect,strf
         : Optional arguments, see champ.

DESCRIPTION
  fchamp is used to draw the direction field of a 2D first order ODE defined
  by the external function f. Note that if the ODE is autonomous, argument t
  is useless, but it must be given.

EXAMPLE
  deff("[xdot] = derpol(t,x)",..
          ["xd1 = x(2)";..
           "xd2 = -x(1) + (1 - x(1)**2)*x(2)";..
           "xdot = [ xd1 ; xd2 ]"])
  xf= -1:0.1:1;
  yf= -1:0.1:1;
