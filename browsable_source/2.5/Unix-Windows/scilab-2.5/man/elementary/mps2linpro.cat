mps2linpro(1)                  Scilab Function                  mps2linpro(1)
NAME
  mps2linpro - convert lp problem given in MPS format to linpro format

CALLING SEQUENCE
  lp = mps2linpro(mps)
  [p,C,b,ci,cs,mi] = mps2linpro(mps)

PARAMETERS

  mps       : either a character string, path of the MPS file, or an mps data
            structure returned by readmps

  lp        : a linpro data tlist with following fields:

            p         : real (column) vector (dimension  n)

            C         : real matrix (dimension  (mi + md) x n) (If no con-
                      straints are given, you can set C = [])

            b         : RHS vector (dimension 1 x (mi + md))

            ci        : (column) vector of lower-bounds (dimension  n).  If
                      there are no lower bound constraints, put ci = [].  If
                      some components of x are bounded from below, set the
                      other (unconstrained) values of ci to a very large neg-
                      ative  number (e.g. ci(j) = -(% eps)^(-1).

            cs        : (column) vector of upper-bounds. (Same remarks as
                      above).

            mi        : number of equality constraints (i.e. C(1:mi,:)*x =
                      b(1:mi))

DESCRIPTION
  mps2linpro forms Linear programing data compatible with linpro out of MPS
  data format.
