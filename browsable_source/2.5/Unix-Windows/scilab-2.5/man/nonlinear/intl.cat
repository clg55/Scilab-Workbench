intl(1)                        Scilab Function                        intl(1)
NAME
  intl - Cauchy integral

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [y]=intl(a,b,z0,r,f)

PARAMETERS

  z0          : complex number

  a,b         : two real numbers

  r           : positive real number

  f           : "external" function

DESCRIPTION
  If f is a complex-valued function, intl(a,b,z0,r,f) computes the integral
  of f(z)dz along the curve in the complex plane defined by z0 + r.exp(%i*t)
  for a<=t<=b .(part of the circle with center z0 and radius r with phase
  between a and b)
