bdiag(2)                       Scilab Function                       bdiag(2)
NAME
  bdiag - block diagonalization, generalized eigenvectors

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [Ab [,X [,bs]]]=bdiag(A [,rmax])

PARAMETERS

  A    : real or complex square matrix

  rmax  : real number

  Ab : real or complex square matrix

  X : real or complex non-singular matrix

  bs : vector of integers

DESCRIPTION
  [Ab [,X [,bs]]]=bdiag(A [,rmax])
  performs the block-diagonalization of matrix A.  bs gives the structure of
  the blocks (respective sizes of the blocks).  X is the change of basis i.e
  Ab = inv(X)*A*X is block diagonal.

  rmax controls the conditioning of X; the default value is the l1 norm of A.

  To get a diagonal form (if it exists) choose a large value for rmax
  (rmax=1/%eps for example).  Generically (for real random A) the blocks are
  (1x1) and (2x2) and X is the matrix of eigenvectors.

EXAMPLE
  //Real case: 1x1 and 2x2 blocks
  a=rand(5,5);[ab,x,bs]=bdiag(a);ab
  //Complex case: complex 1x1 blocks
  [ab,x,bs]=bdiag(a+%i*0);ab
