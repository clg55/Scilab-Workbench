colregul(1)                    Scilab Function                    colregul(1)
NAME
  colregul - removing poles and zeros at infinity

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [Stmp,Ws]=colregul(Sl,alfa,beta)

PARAMETERS

  Sl,Stmp        : syslin lists

  alfa,beta : reals (new pole and zero positions)

DESCRIPTION
  computes a prefilter Ws such that Stmp=Sl*Ws is proper and with full rank D
  matrix.

  Poles at infinity of Sl are moved to alfa;

  Zeros at infinity of Sl are moved to beta;

  Sl is a assumed to be a left invertible linear system (syslin list) in
  state-space representation with possibly a polynomial D matrix.
