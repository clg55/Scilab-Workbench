NAME
  comp -  scilab function compilation

CALLING SEQUENCE
  comp(function [,opt])

PARAMETERS

  function
       : an not compiled scilab function (type 11)

  opt  : integer flag with value 0 (default) or 1.

DESCRIPTION
  comp(function) compiles the function function.  Compiled and interpreted
  functions are equivalent but usually compiled functions are much faster.
  The functions provided in the standard libraries are compiled.

  The command: getf('filename') loads the functions in file 'filename' and
  compiles them.  So comp has to be used in very particular cases.

  The opt==1 option is specific to code analysis purpose (see macr2lst)

REMARKS
  commands who, help, what cannot be compiled.
