.SH DESCRIPTION
With this command it is possible to use an external program 
as a Scilab command
where  \fV(s_1,s_2,...,s_lhs)\fR are the output variables and
 \fV(e_1,e_2,...,e_rhs)\fR are the input variables. To insert this command 
in Scilab one has to write a few lines in the user fortran subroutine
of Scilab. See \fVintersci\fR or the Scilab documentation for more information.
