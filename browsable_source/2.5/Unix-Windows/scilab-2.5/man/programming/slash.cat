NAME
  slash (/) - right division and feed back

DESCRIPTION
  Right division.  x=A / b is the solution of x*b=A .

  b/a = (a' \ b')' .

  a ./  b is the matrix with entries a(i,j)/ b(i,j).  If b is scalar (1x1
  matrix) this operation is the same as  a./b*ones(a). (Same convention if a
  is a scalar).

  Remark that 123./b is interpreted as (123)./b. In this cases dot is part of
  the operator, not of the number.

  Backslash stands for left division.

  System feed back.  S=G/.K evaluates S=G*(eye()+K*G)^(-1) this operator
  avoid simplification problem.

  Remark that G/.5 is interpreted as G/(.5). In such cases dot is part of the
  number, not of the operator.
  Comment // comments a line i.e lines which begin by // are ignored by the
  interpreter.
