exec(1)                        Scilab Function                        exec(1)
NAME
  exec - script file execution

CALLING SEQUENCE
  exec(path [,mode])
  exec(fun [,mode])
  ierr=exec(path,'errcatch' [,mode])
  ierr=exec(fun,'errcatch' [,mode])

PARAMETERS

  path : a string, the path of the script file

  mode : an integer scalar, the execution mode (see below)

  fun  : a scilab function

  ierr : integer, 0 or error number
DESCRIPTION
  exec(path [,mode]) executes sequentialy the scilab instructions contained
  in the file given by path  with an optional execution mode mode .
  The different cases for mode are :

  00    : the default value

  --11   : nothing is printed

  11    : echo of each command line

  22    : prompt --> is printed

  33    : echoes + prompts

  44    : stops before each prompt

  77    : stops + prompts + echoes : useful mode for demos.

  exec(fun [,mode]) executes function  fun as a script: no input nor output
  argument nor specific variable environment. This form is more efficient,
  because script code may be pre-compiled (see getf, comp). This method for
  script evaluation allows to store scripts as function in libraries.

  If an error is encountered while executing , if 'errcatch' flag is present
  exec issues an error message, aborts execution of the
   instructions and resume with ierr equal to the error number,if 'errcatch'
  flag is not present, standard error handling works.

REMARK
  Last line of script file must be terminated by a newline to be taken into
  account.
EXAMPLES
  // create a script file
  write(TMPDIR+'/myscript','a=1;b=2')
  // execute it
  exec(TMPDIR+'/myscript')
  who

  //create a function
  deff('y=foo(x)','a=x+1;y=a^2')
  clear a b
  //execute the function
  foo(1)
  // a is a variable created in the environment of the function foo
  //    it is destroyed when foo returns
  who

  x=1 //create x to make it known by the script foo
  exec(foo)
  // a and y are created in the current environment
  who
