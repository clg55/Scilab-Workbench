matrix(1)                      Scilab Function                      matrix(1)
NAME
  matrix - reshape a vector or a matrix to a different size matrix

CALLING SEQUENCE
  y=matrix(v,n,m)
  y=matrix(v,[sizes])

PARAMETERS

  v         : a vector, a matrix or an hypermatrix
  n,m       : integers

  sizes     : vector of integers

  y         : a vector  matrix or hypermatrix

DESCRIPTION
  For a vector or a matrix with n x m entries y=matrix(v,n,m) or similarily
  y=matrix(v,[n,m]).  transforms the v vector (or matrix) into an nxm matrix
  by stacking columnwise the entries of v.

  if one of the dimension m or n is equal to -1 it is automatically assigned
  to the quotient of  size(v,'*') by the other dimension,

  For an hypermatrix such as prod(size(v))==prod(sizes),y=matrix(v,sizes) (or
  equivalently y=matrix(v,n1,n2,...nm)) transforms v  into an  matrix or
  hypermatrix by stacking columnwise the entries of v. y=matrix(v,sizes)
  results in a regular matrix if sizes is a scalar or a 2-vector.
