mode(1)                        Scilab Function                        mode(1)
NAME
  mode - select a mode in exec file

CALLING SEQUENCE
  mode(k)
  k=mode()

DESCRIPTION
  Used inside an exec-file or a scilab function mode(k) allows to change the
  information displayed during the execution, depending on the value of k:

  k=0  : The new variable values are displayed if required (see help on semi
       or comma).

  k=-1 : the exec file or scilab function executes silently. (this is the
       default value for scilab functions)

  k=1 or k=3
       : each line of instructions is echoed preceded of the prompt. The new
       variable values are displayed if required. This is the default for
       exec files.

  k=7  : The new variable values are displayed if required, each line of
       instructions is echoed (if possible) and a prompt (>>) is issued after
       each line waiting for a carriage return.

  line display is disable for compiled scilab function (see getf or comp)
