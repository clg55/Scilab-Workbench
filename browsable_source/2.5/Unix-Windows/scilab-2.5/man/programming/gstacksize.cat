gstacksize(1)                  Scilab Function                  gstacksize(1)
NAME
  gstacksize - set/get scilab global stack size

CALLING SEQUENCE
  gstacksize(n)
  sz=gstacksize()

PARAMETERS

  n         : integer, the required global stack size given in number of dou-
            ble precision words

  sz        : 2-vector [total used]

DESCRIPTION
  Scilab stores gobal variables in a stack
  gstacksize(n) allows the user to increase or decrease the size of this
  stack. The maximum allowed size depends on the amount of free memory and
  swap space available at the time. Note that Scilab can increase automati-
  cally the global stacksize when needed
  sz=gstacksize() returns a 2-vector which contains  the current total and
  used global stack size.
