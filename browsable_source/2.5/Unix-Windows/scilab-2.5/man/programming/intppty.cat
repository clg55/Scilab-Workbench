intppty(1)                     Scilab Function                     intppty(1)
NAME
  intppty - set interface argument passing properties

CALLING SEQUENCE
  funs=intppty()
  intppty(fun)

PARAMETERS

  fun       : integer an interface number (see funptr)

  funs      : integer vector, vector of interface number (see funptr)

DESCRIPTION
  The interface programs may be written in 2 different ways for the mode of
  function argument passing.

  In the first and default way, the arguments are passed by value.  With the
  following syntax:
  foo(A,1+2)
  the argument associated with A will be passed by value (a copy of A is made
  before foo is called, and the argument associated with 1+2 will be passed
  by value.

  In the second way arguments may be passed be reference if there are "named
  arguments" (no copy of the variable value is done). intppty(fun) with fun>0
  tells Scilab that the interface with number fun can handle arguments passed
  by reference. With the following syntax:
  foo(A,1+2)
  the argument associated with A will be passed by reference, and the argu-
  ment associated with 1+2 will be passed by value.

  Warning, declaring that the interface with number fun can handle arguments
  passed by reference if it is not the case should produce unpredictable
  results.

  intppty(fun) with fun<0 suppress this property for the interface -fun.

  intppty() returns the vector of interfaces which handle arguments passed by
  reference.

  This function may be useful for dynamically loaded interface (see addin-
  ter).
