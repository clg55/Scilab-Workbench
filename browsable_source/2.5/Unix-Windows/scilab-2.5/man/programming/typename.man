.SH DESCRIPTION
The function and operator overloading make use of a formal name
associated to data types to form the name of the overloading function
(see overloading). The \fVtypename\fR can be used to handle this
formal names for hard coded data types (the \fVtlist\fR or \fVmlist\fR
coded data types formal names are defined in an other way, see \fVoverloading\fR).
.LP
Called without right hand side argument, \fVtypename\fR returns
informations on defined data types.
.LP
