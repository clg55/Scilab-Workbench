if(1)                          Scilab Function                          if(1)
NAME
  if then else - conditional execution

SYNTAX
  if expr1 then statements
  elseif expri then statements
    ....
  else  statements
  end

DESCRIPTION
  The if statement evaluates a logical expression and executes a group of
  statements when the expression is true.

  The  expri are expressions with numeric or boolean values. If expri are
  matrix valued the condition is true only if all matrix entries are true.

   The optional elseif and else provide for the execution of alternate groups
  of statements. An end keyword, which matches the if, terminates the last
  group of statements. The line structure given above is not significant, the
  only constraint is that each then keyword must be on the same line line as
  its corresponding if or elseif keyword.
  The keyword then can be replaced by a carriage return or a comma.

  Warning: the number of characters used to define the body of any condition-
  nal instruction (if while for or select/case) must be limited to 16k.
EXAMPLE
     i=2
     for j = 1:3,
        if i == j then
          a(i,j) = 2;
        elseif abs(i-j) == 1 then
          a(i,j) = -1;
        else a(i,j) = 0;
        end,
     end
