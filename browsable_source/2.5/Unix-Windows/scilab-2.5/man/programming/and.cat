NAME
  and (&) - logical and

CALLING SEQUENCE
  b=and(A),  b=and(A,'*')
  b=and(A,'r'), b=and(A,1)
  b=and(A,'c'), b=and(A,2)
  A&B

DESCRIPTION
  and(A) is the logical AND of elements of the boolean matrix A. and(A)
  returns %T ("true")  iff all entries of A are %T.

  y=and(A,'r') (or, equivalently, y=and(A,1)) is the rowwise and. It returns
  in each entry of the row vector y the and of the rows of x (The and is per-
  formed on the row index : y(j)= and(A(i,j),i=1,m)).

  y=and(A,'c') (or, equivalently, y=and(A,2)) is the columnwise and. It
  returns in each entry of the column vector y the and of the columns of x
  (The and is performed on the column index:  y(i)= and(A(i,j),j=1,n))).

  A&B  gives the element-wise logical and of the booleans matrices
   A and  B .A and  B must be matrices with the same
   dimensions or one from them must be a single boolean.
