artest(1)                      Scilab Function                      artest(1)
NAME
  lotest - demo of the Lorenz attractor

CALLING SEQUENCE
  []=lotest([f_l,odem,xdim,npts,pinit])
  [y]=lorenz(t,x)
  []=ilo(sig,ro,beta)
  []=ilof(sig,ro,beta)

PARAMETERS

  f_l  : can be "loren" or lorenz. it is the name of the external for the
       Lorenz system.  "loren" will use a Fortran coded version of the lorenz
       system and arnold will and loren will use a Scilab coded ver-
       sion.lorentz is the Scilab macro which code the lorenz system.
        This macro is loaded when calling lotest.

  ilof, ilo
       :are used to fix the parameters of the Fortran and Scilab code version
       of the Lorenz system.

  odem,xdim,npts
       : are optional arguments. Their meaning and syntax can be found in the
       portr3d help

DESCRIPTION
  A call to the function lotest() will interactively display a phase portrait
  of  a the following dynamical system
          y(1)=sig*(x(2)-x(1));
          y(2)=ro*x(1) -x(2)-x(1)*x(3);
          y(3)=-beta*x(3)+x(1)*x(2);
