NAME
  graph-list - description of graph list

DESCRIPTION
  A graph in Scilab is represented by a Scilab typed list.  We call it a
  graph list.

  You will find below the complete description of the list.  Each element is
  described by one or more lines.  The first line gives the name of the ele-
  ment and its definition. Additional informations, such as the default for
  elements that can have one, are given in the other lines.  Indeed, only the
  5 first elements must have a value in the list, all the others can be given
  the empty vector [] as a value, and then the default is used when it is
  needed by functions or by the Metanet window.  For instance, you can define
  a graph list by
  g=make_graph('min',1,1,[1],[1]);
  which is the simplest graph you can create in Metanet (it is directed, has
  one node and one loop arc on this node).

  The name of the element in the list is very important because it is used to
  access the elements of the list. For instance, if g is a graph list, to get
  the name of the graph, you only have to do:
  g('name')
  and if you want to change the name of the graph to 'toto', you have to do:
  g('name')='toto';

  Moreover, you can get the number of edges and the number of arcs of the
  graph by using edge_number(g) and arc_number(g) (these names do not corre-
  spond to elements of the list). For compatibility, node_number(g) can also
  be used instead of g('node_number').

  A graph list can be syntactically correct but not represent a good graph.
  You can use the function check_graph to check it.  Moreover it is a good
  idea to give nodes different names. In fact, this does not give errors in
  Scilab, but strange behaviour can appear when using the Metanet window.
  This is not checked by check_graph because it is time consuming. It is only
  checked when loading, saving or showing a graph.

  The elements of a graph list are given below:
  name: - the name of the graph

        - it is a string with a maximum of 80 characters
  directed: - flag giving the type of the graph

            - it is equal to 1 (graph directed) or equal to 0 (graph undi-
              rected)

             - the type is an integer from 0 to 2, default is 0 (plain node):
