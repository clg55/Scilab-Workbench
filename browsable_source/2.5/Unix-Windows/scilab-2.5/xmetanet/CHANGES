		     Main Changes Scilab 2.4 -> 2.4.1
		     ================================

Many bugs fixed.

Option "--without-pvm" added to configure to compile Scilab 
  without PVM library.

NEW MACHINES
============

Scilab runs now on MAC Mklinux and DEC Alpha Linux.

NEW FUNCTIONALITIES
===================

The Matlab to Scilab translator has been considerably improved.

After fixing a number of bugs, Scicos is no longer considered a beta release.

Metanet toolbox: Function "netclose" for closing a Metanet window 
                 has been added.

		      Main Changes Scilab 2.3 -> 2.4
		      ==============================

WINDOWS 95/NT
=============

This version is no longer a beta version. Incremental link is now possible.

PVM interface and Xmetanet do not work yet.

NEW TOOLBOXES
=============

m2sci: beta version of a Matlab to Scilab translator.

Fraclab: fractal and wavelet analysis.

Tksci: beta Tcl/Tk interface.

PVM: beta PVM interface (not yet available on Windows).

dcd: cumulative distribution functions and inverses...

grand: random number generators.

NEW FUNCTIONALITIES
===================

Metanet toolbox: Function "pipe_network" for solving the pipe network problem 
                 has been added.

Scicos toolbox: - New and improved formalism
                - Faster Compiler 
                - Improved GUI

Maple toolbox: The Maple to Scilab interface (maple/maple2scilab.mpl)
               has been improved. Sparse matrices are handled. There is
               now the choice between C and Fortran code generation.

Nonlinear toolbox: Addition of 2D and 3D definite integrals int2d et int3d.

Data types: N dimensional arrays have been introduced (see hypermatrices).

chdir and getcwd functions added to change and get working directory.

Floating points exception handling may be set by "ieee" function.

Overloading: It is now possible to overload display of tlist data
             structure. It is also possible to extend basic primitive
             function definition to new data types. To avoid possible
             ambiguity overloading function names have been
             changed. Old names still work, but for efficiency it
             desirable to change it. See overloading help.

Syntax: Functions with strings arguments may be called as commands.
        For instance "exec('foo.sce')" can be entered as "exec foo.sce".

        It is now possible to define functions with unbounded number
        of input and output arguments (see varargin help).

INCOMPATIBILITIES
=================

Some old Scicos diagrams may not be translated properly into Scilab 2.4.

Binary files created by "save" in Scilab 2.4 cannot be read by Scilab 2.3.

Scicos diagrams created by "save" in Scilab 2.4 cannot be read by Scilab 2.3.
