
The purpose of this contribution is to emulate the Matlab mexfile
mechanism for people too lazy/busy to learn the Scilab dynamic
link interfacing mechanism...

Only the most useful functions have been emulated. 
Nothing is provided to read/write binary .mat files inside mexfiles.
Matlab .mat files saved in Matlab4 format can be read by mtlb_read.  
Any Matlab mexfunction which uses the emulated functions can be used. 
(However, for calling Scilab functions inside 
mexfiles "mexCallSCILAB" should be used instead of "mexCallMATLAB").

-------------------------------------------------------
To build the shared library enter 
	--> exec builder.sce 
	at scilab prompt 
To load the shared library enter 
	--> exec loader.sce 
	at scilab prompt 

To run a test just exec the libmex.tst file 

You can also build and run all the tests with 
	make tests (Unix) 
	nmake /f Makefile.mak tests (visual C++)
