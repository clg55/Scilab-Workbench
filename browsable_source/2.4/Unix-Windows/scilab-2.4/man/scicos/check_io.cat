NAME
  check_io - Checks and sets Scicos block port numbers.

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [model,graphics,ok]=check_io(model,graphics,in,out,clkin,clkout)

PARAMETERS

  model     : Scicos model data structure (see scicos_model)

  graphics  : Scicos graphics data structure (see scicos_graphics)

  in        : vector of regular input port sizes. Set in=[] in no regular
            input port

  out       : vector of regular output port sizes. Set out=[] in no regular
            output port

  clkin     : vector of event input port sizes. Set clkin=[] in no event
            input port

  clkout    : vector of event output port sizes. Set clkout=[] in no event
            output port

  ok        : boolean, %t if specified input/output have been correctly set.
            %f if specified input/output cannot be taken into account.
DESCRIPTION
  This function is to be called when number of regular or event input or out-
  put ports is modified. It check if it is possible (connected ports cannot
  suppressed) and updates  model and  graphics block substructures.  in, out,
  clkin, clkout are the vectors of port sizes for respectively the regular
  inputs, regular outputs, event inputs and event outputs.

  Negative values in  in or  out vector means that corresponding ports dimen-
  sion are to be determined by the context. Two equal negative values means
  that corresponding ports have same size.
