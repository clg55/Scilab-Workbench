.SH DIALOGUE PARAMETERS
.TP 20
Vector of p mesh points
: a vector which defines \fVu2\fR mesh points.
Numerator roots
: a matrix, each line gives the roots of the numerator at the
corresponding mesh point.
.TP
Denominator roots
: a matrix, each line gives the roots of the denominator at the
corresponding mesh point.
.TP
gain
: a vector, each vector entry gives the transfer gain at the
corresponding mesh point.
.TP
past inputs
: a vector of initial value of past \fVdegree(Numerator)\fR inputs
.TP
past outputs
: a vector of initial value of past \fVdegree(Denominator)\fR outputs

.SH DESCRIPTION
This block realizes a SISO linear system represented by its rational
transfer function whose numerator and denominator roots are tabulated
functions of the second block input. The rational function must be
proper.

Roots are interpolated linearly between mesh points.
