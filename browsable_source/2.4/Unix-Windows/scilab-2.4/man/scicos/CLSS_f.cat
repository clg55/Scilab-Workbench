CLSS_f(5)                       Scicos Block                        CLSS_f(5)
NAME
  CLSS_f - Scicos continuous-time linear state-space system

DESCRIPTION
  This block realizes a continuous-time linear state-space system.
  xdot=A*x+B*u
  y   =C*x+D*u
  The system is defined by the (A,B,C,D) matrices and the initial state x0.
  The dimensions must be compatible.

DIALOGUE PARAMETERS

  A                   : square matrix. The A matrix

  B                   : the B matrix, [] if system has no input

  C                   : the C matrix , [] if system has no output

  D                   : the D matrix, [] if system has no D term.

  x0                  : vector. The initial state of the system.
