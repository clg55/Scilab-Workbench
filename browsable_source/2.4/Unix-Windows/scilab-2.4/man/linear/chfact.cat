chfact(G)                      Scilab Function                      chfact(G)
NAME
  chfact - sparse Cholesky factorization

CALLING SEQUENCE
  spcho=chfact(A)

PARAMETERS

  A    : square symmetric positive sparse matrix

  spcho
       : list containing the Cholesky factors in coded form

DESCRIPTION
  spcho=chfact(A) computes the sparse Cholesky factors of sparse matrix A,
  assumed symmetric positive definite.  This function is based on the Ng-
  Peyton programs (ORNL). See the Fortran programs for a complete description
  of the variables in spcho. This function is to be used with chsolve.
