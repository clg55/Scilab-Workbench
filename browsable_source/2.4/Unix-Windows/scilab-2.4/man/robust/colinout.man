.SH PARAMETERS
.TP 4
G  
: linear system (\fVsyslin\fR list) \fV[A,B,C,D]\fR
.TP 
Inn
:  inner factor (\fVsyslin\fR list)
.TP 
Gbar
:  outer factor (\fVsyslin\fR list)
.TP 
X   
:  row-compressor of \fVG\fR (\fVsyslin\fR list)
.SH DESCRIPTION
Inner-outer factorization (and column compression) of (lxp) \fVG =[A,B,C,D]\fR with l<=p.
.LP
\fVG\fR is assumed to be fat (\fVl<=p\fR) without zero on the imaginary axis
and with a \fVD\fR matrix which is full row rank.
.LP
\fVG\fR must also be stable for having \fVGbar\fR stable.
.LP
Dual of \fVrowinout\fR.
