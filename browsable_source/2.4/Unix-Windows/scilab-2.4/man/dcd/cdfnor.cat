NAME
  cdfnor - cumulative distribution function normal distribution

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [P,Q]=cdfnor("PQ",X,Mean,Std)
  [X]=cdfnor("X",Mean,Std,P,Q)
  [Mean]=cdfnor("Mean",Std,P,Q,X)
  [Std]=cdfnor("Std",P,Q,X,Mean)

PARAMETERS

  P,Q,X,Mean,Std
            : six real vectors of the same size.

  P,Q (Q=1-P)
            : The integral from -infinity to X of the normal density.  Input
            range: (0,1].

  X         :Upper limit of integration of the normal-density.  Input range:
            ( -infinity, +infinity)

  Mean      :  The mean of the normal density.  Input range: (-infinity,
            +infinity)

  Sd        :  Standard Deviation of the normal density.  Input range: (0,
            +infinity).

DESCRIPTION
  Calculates any one parameter of the normal distribution given values for
  the others.

  A slightly modified version of ANORM from Cody, W.D. (1993). "ALGORITHM
  715: SPECFUN - A Portabel FORTRAN Package of Special Function Routines and
  Test Drivers" acm Transactions on Mathematical Software. 19, 22-32.  is
  used to calulate the  cumulative standard normal distribution.

  The rational functions from pages  90-95  of Kennedy and Gentle, Statisti-
  cal  Computing,  Marcel  Dekker, NY,  1980 are  used  as starting values to
  Newton's Iterations which compute the inverse standard normal.  Therefore
  no  searches  are necessary for  any parameter.

  For X < -15, the asymptotic expansion for the normal is used  as the start-
  ing value in finding the inverse standard normal.  This is formula 26.2.12
  of Abramowitz and Stegun.

  The normal density is proportional to exp( - 0.5 * (( X - MEAN)/SD)**2)
