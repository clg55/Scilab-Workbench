power(1)                       Scilab Function                       power(1)
NAME
  power - power operation  (^,.^)

CALLING SEQUENCE
  t=A^b
  t=A**b
  t=A.^b

PARAMETERS

  A,t  : scalar, polynomial or rational matrix.

  b    :a scalar, a vector or a scalar matrix.

DESCRIPTION

  (A:square)^(b:scalar)
       : If A is a square matrix and b is a scalar then A^b is the matrix A
       to the power b.

  (A:matrix).^(b:scalar)
       : If b is a scalar and A a matrix then A.^b is the matrix formed by
       the element of A to the power b (elementwise power). If A is a vector
       and b is a scalar then A^b and A.^b performs the same operation (i.e
       elementwise power).

  (A:scalar).^(b:matrix)
       If A is a scalar  and b is a scalar matrix (or vector) A^b and A.^b
       are the matrices (or vectors) formed by   a^(b(i,j)).

  (A:matrix).^(b:matrix)
       If A and b  are vectors (matrices) with compatible dimensions A.^b is
       the  A(i)^b(i) vector (A(i,j)^b(i,j) matrix).

  Notes:

  --    For square matrices A^p is computed through successive matrices multi-
       plications if p is a positive integer, and by diagonalization if not.

  --    ** and ^ operators are synonyms.

EXAMPLE
  A=[1 2;3 4];
  A^2.5,
  A.^2.5
  (1:10)^2
  (1:10).^2

  s=poly(0,'s')
  s^(1:10)
