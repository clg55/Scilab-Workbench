AdCommunications - advanced communication toolbox for parallel programming  
Example - just to test the environment  
pvm - communications with other applications using parallel virutal machine  
pvm_addhosts - add hosts to the virtual machine.  
pvm_barrier - blocks the calling process until all processes  
pvm_bcast - broacasts a message to all members of a group  
pvm_config - sends a message  
pvm_delhosts - deletes hosts from the virtual machine.  
pvm_exit - tells the local pvmd that this process is leaving pvm.  
pvm_get_timer - gets the system's notion of the current time.  
pvm_getinst - returns the instance number in a group of a pvm process.  
pvm_gettid - returns the tid of the process identified by a  
pvm_gsize - returns the number of members presently in the named group.  
pvm_halt - stops the pvm daemon  
pvm_joingroup - enrolls the calling process in a named group.  
pvm_kill - terminates a specified pvm process.  
pvm_lvgroup - unenrolls the calling process from a named group.  
pvm_mytid - returns the \fitid\fr of the calling process.  
pvm_parent - returns the tid of the process that spawned  
pvm_recv - receive a message.  
pvm_send - immediately sends (or multicast) data.  
pvm_set_timer - sets the system's notion of the current time.  
pvm_spawn - starts new scilab processes.  
pvm_spawn_independent - starts new pvm processes.  
pvm_start - start the pvm daemon  
pvm_tasks - returns information about the tasks running  
pvm_tidtohost - returns the host of the specified pvm process.  
pvmd3 - pvm daemon
