This directory contains evaluation programs for testing Scilab's
installation on your machine.

1- to run a global test on various functions type "make tests"
   in this directory. Results of the tests are compared to 
   corresponding references. Failure of a test does not necessarily
   imply bad installation. Failure may be due to small differences
   in machine constants. This can happen in particular in "matopt.tst".

2- to run test on a specific item, invoke Scilab in this directory
   and  type "exec('<item>.tst')" at Scilab prompt.
