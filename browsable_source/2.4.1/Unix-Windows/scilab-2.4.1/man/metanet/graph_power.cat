graph_power(1)                 Scilab function                 graph_power(1)
NAME
  graph_power - kth power of a directed 1-graph

CALLING SEQUENCE
  g1 = graph_power(g,k)

PARAMETERS

  g : graph list of the graph

  k : integer

  g1 : graph list of the new graph

DESCRIPTION
  graph_power computes the directed graph g1 which is the kth power of
  directed 1-graph g.  There is an arc between two nodes in g1 if there
  exists a path between these nodes of length at most k in g.
  graph_power(g,1) is graph g.

  If such a graph does not exist, an empty vector is returned.

EXAMPLE
  ta=[1 1 2 4 4 5 6 7 2 3 5 1];
  he=[2 6 3 6 7 8 8 8 4 7 3 5];
  g=make_graph('foo',1,8,ta,he);
  g('node_x')=[285  284  335  160  405  189  118  45];
  g('node_y')=[266  179   83  176  368  252  64  309];
  show_graph(g);
  g1=graph_power(g,2);
  show_graph(g1,'new');
