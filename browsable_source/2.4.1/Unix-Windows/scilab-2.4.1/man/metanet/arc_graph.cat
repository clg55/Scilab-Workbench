arc_graph(1)                   Scilab function                   arc_graph(1)
NAME
  arc_graph - graph with nodes corresponding to arcs

CALLING SEQUENCE
  g1 = arc_graph(g)

PARAMETERS

  g : graph list of the old graph

  g1 : graph list of the new graph

DESCRIPTION
  arc_graph returns the directed graph g1 with the nodes corresponding to the
  arcs of the directed graph g.  g1 is defined in the following way:

  - its nodes correspond to the arcs of g

  - 2 nodes of the new graph are adjacent if and only if the corresponding
  arcs of the graph g are consecutive.

  The coordinates of the nodes of g1 are given by the middle points of the
  corresponding edges of g.

  If such an arc graph does not exist, an empty vector is returned.

EXAMPLE
  ta=[1 1 2 4 4 5 6 7 2 3 5 1];
  he=[2 6 3 6 7 8 8 8 4 7 3 5];
  g=make_graph('foo',1,8,ta,he);
  g('node_x')=[281  284  360  185  405  182  118  45];
  g('node_y')=[262  179  130  154  368  248  64  309];
  show_graph(g);
  g1=arc_graph(g);
  show_graph(g1,'new');
