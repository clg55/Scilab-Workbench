Communications(1)            Scilab description             Communications(1)
NAME
  Communications - communications with other applications using GeCi

DESCRIPTION
  This the beta version of the Communications Toolbox.

  GeCi manages communications between Scilab and other applications (included
  Scilab itself) by using GeCi.

  GeCI is an interactive communication manager created in order to manage
  remote executions of softwares and allow exchanges of messages between
  those softwares. It offers the possibility to exploit numerous machines on
  a network, as a virtual computer, by creating a distributed group of
  independent softwares.

  In order to communicate, the other applications must have been prepared
  for, by including a communication library in them. The way to do this is
  described in the Communication Toolbox documentation.
