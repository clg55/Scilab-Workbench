MCLOCK_f(5)                     Scicos Block                      MCLOCK_f(5)
NAME
  MCLOCK_f - Scicos 2 frequency event clock

DESCRIPTION
  This block is a Super Block constructed by feeding back the outputs of an
  MFCLCK block into its input event port. The two outputs of this block gen-
  erate regular train of events, the frequency of the first input being equal
  to that of the second output divided by an integer n. The two outputs are
  synchronized (this is impossible for standard blocks; this is a Super
  Block).

DIALOGUE PARAMETERS

  Basic period   : scalar. equals 1/f, f being the highest frequency.

  n              : an intger >1. the frequency of the first output event is
                 f/n.
