DESCRIPTION
  pvm_delhosts deletes the computers of hosts from the existing configuration
  of computers making up the virtual machine.  All PVM processes and the pvmd
  running on these computers are killed as the computer is deleted.  The
  array infos can be checked to determine the status of each host.  Values
  less than zero indicate an error, while zero values indicate a success.
  If a host fails, the PVM system will continue to function and will automat-
  ically delete this host from the virtual machine.  It is the responsibility
  of the application developer to make his application tolerant of host
  failure.
