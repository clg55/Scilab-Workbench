.SH NAME
pvm - communications with other applications using Parallel Virutal Machine
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I PVM
is a software system that enables a collection of heterogeneous
computers to be used as a coherent and flexible concurrent computational
resource.

The individual computers may be shared- or local-memory multiprocessors,
vector supercomputers, specialized graphics engines, or scalar
workstations, that may be interconnected by a variety of networks,
such as ethernet, FDDI.

Daemon programs (\fIpvmd3\fR) provide communication and process control
between computers (see PVM manpage and manual for more details).

Most important functions of the PVM communication library are included in Scilab.

.SH WARNING
PVM must be installed in your envriromnent before using it in Scilab. PVM
scilab have been developped using the version 3.3.7 of the PVM library.

.SH AUTHORS
PVM have been developped by A. L. Beguelin, J. J. Dongarra, G. A. Geist, W. C. Jiang, R. J. Manchek, B. K. Moore, V. S. Sunderam (see http://www.netlib.org/pvm3)
