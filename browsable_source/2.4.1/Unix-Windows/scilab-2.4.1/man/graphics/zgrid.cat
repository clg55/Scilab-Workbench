NAME
  zgrid - zgrid plot

CALLING SEQUENCE
  zgrid()

DESCRIPTION
  plots z-plane grid lines: lines of constant damping factor (zeta) and
  natural frequency (Wn) are drawn in within the unit Z-plane circle.

  Iso-frequency curves are shown in frequency*step on the interval [0,0.5].
  Upper limit corresponds to Shannon frequency ( 1/dt > 2*f ).
