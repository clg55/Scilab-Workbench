sum(1)                         Scilab Function                         sum(1)
NAME
  sum - sum (row sum, column sum) of vector/matrix entries

CALLING SEQUENCE
  y=sum(x)
  y=sum(x,'r') or y=sum(x,1)

  y=sum(x,'c') or y=sum(x,2)

PARAMETERS

  x         : vector or matrix (real, complex, sparse or polynomial)

  y         : scalar or vector

DESCRIPTION
  For a vector or a matrix x, y=sum(x)  returns in the scalar y the sum of
  all the entries of x.

  y=sum(x,'r') (or, equivalently, y=sum(x,1)) is the rowwise sum. It returns
  in each entry of the row vector y the sum of the rows of x (The sum is per-
  formed on the row indice : y(j)= sum(x(i,j),i=1,m)).

  y=sum(x,'c') (or, equivalently, y=sum(x,2)) is the columnwise sum. It
  returns in each entry of the column vector y the sum of the columns of x
  (The sum is performed on the column indice:  y(i)= sum(x(i,j),j=1,n))).

EXAMPLE
  A=[1,2;3,4];
  trace(A)-sum(diag(A))
  sum(A,'c')-A*ones(2,1)
  sum(A+%i)
  A=sparse(A);sum(A,'c')-A*ones(2,1)
  s=poly(0,'s');
  M=[s,%i+s;s^2,1];
  sum(M),sum(M,2)
