gsort(1)                       Scilab Function                       gsort(1)
NAME
  gsort - decreasing order sorting

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [s, [k]]=gsort(v )
  [s, [k]]=gsort(v,flag1)
  [s, [k]]=gsort(v,flag1,flag2)

PARAMETERS

  v,s  : real vector/matrix; character string vector/matrix

  flag1
       : a string 'r', 'c','g','lr' and 'lc'.

  flag2
       : a string 'i' for increasing and 'd' for decreasing order.  k : vec-
       tor or matrix of integers

DESCRIPTION
  gsort is similar to sort with additional properties. The third argument can
  be used to chose between increasing or decreasing order. The second argu-
  ment can be used for lexical orders.

  [s,k]=gsort(a,'g') and [s,k]=gsort(a,'g','d') are  the same as
  [s,k]=gsort(a). They perform a sort of the entries of matrix a, a being
  seen as the stacked vector a(:) (columnwise). [s,k]=gsort(a,'g','i') per-
  forms the same operation but in increasing order.

  [s,k]=gsort(a,'lr') sort the rows of the matrix int(a) ( if a is a real
  matrix) or a (if a is a character string matrix) in lexical decreasing
  order. s is obtained by a permutation of the rows of matrix int(a) (or a)
  given by the column vector k) in such a way that the rows of s verify
  s(i,:) > s(j,:) if i<j. [s,k]=gsort(a,'lr','i') performs the same operation
  for increasing lexical order

  [s,k]=gsort(a,'lc') sort the columns of the matrix int(a) ( if a is a real
  matrix) or a (if a is a character string matrix) in lexical decreasing
  order. s is obtained by a permutation of the columns of matrix int(a) (or
  a) given by the row vector k) in such a way that the columns of s verify
  s(:,i) > s(:,j) if i<j. [s,k]=gsort(a,'lc','i') performs the same operation
  for increasing lexical order

EXAMPLE
  alr=[1,2,2;
       1,2,1;
       1,1,2;
       1,1,1];
  [alr1,k]=gsort(alr,'lr','i')
  [alr1,k]=gsort(alr,'lc','i')
