NAME
  scanf_conversion - scanf, sscanf, fscanf conversion specifications

DESCRIPTION
  Each conversion specification in the format parameter contains the follow-
  ing elements:

  +    The character % (percent sign)

  +    The optional assignment suppression character *

  +    An optional numeric maximum field width

  +    A conversion code

  The conversion specification has the following syntax:

  [*][width][size]convcode.

  The results from the conversion are placed in v_i arguments unless you
  specify assignment suppression with * (asterisk). Assignment suppression
  provides a way to describe an input field that is to be skipped. The input
  field is a string of nonwhite-space characters.  It extends to the next
  inappropriate character or until the field width, if specified, is
  exhausted.

  The conversion code indicates how to interpret the input field.
   You should not specify the v_i parameter for a suppressed field. You can
  use the following conversion codes:

  %      :Accepts a single % (percent sign) input at this point; no assign-
         ment is done.

  d, i   :Accepts a decimal integer;

  u      :Accepts an unsigned decimal integer;

  o      :Accepts an octal integer;

  x      :Accepts a hexadecimal integer;

  e,f,g  :Accepts a floating-point number.  The next field is converted
         accordingly and stored through the corresponding parameter, which
         should be a pointer to a float. The input format for floating-point
         numbers is a string of digits, with the following optional charac-
         teristics:

         +   It can be a signed value.

         +   It can be an exponential value, containing a decimal point
             followed by an exponent field, which consists of an E or an e
             followed by an (optionally signed) integer.

         +   It can be one of the special values INF, NaN,

  s      :Accepts a string of characters.

  c      :character value is expected. The normal skip over white space is
         suppressed.
