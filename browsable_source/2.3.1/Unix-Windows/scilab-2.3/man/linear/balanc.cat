balanc(2)                      Scilab Function                      balanc(2)
NAME
  balanc - matrix or pencil balancing

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [Ab,X]=balanc(A)
  [Eb,Ab,X,Y]=balanc(E,A)

PARAMETERS

  A:        a real square matrix

  X:        a real square invertible matrix

  E:        a real square matrix (same dimension as A)

  Y:        a real square invertible matrix.

DESCRIPTION
  Balance a square matrix to improve its condition number.

  [Ab,X] = balanc(A) finds a similarity transformation X such that Ab =
  inv(X)*A*X has approximately equal row and column norms.

  For matrix pencils,balancing is done for improving the generalized eigen-
  value problem.

  [Eb,Ab,X,Y] = balanc(E,A) returns left and right transformations X and Y
  such that Eb=X*E*Y Ab=X*A*Y

Remark
  Balancing is made in the functions bdiag and spec.

EXAMPLE
  A=[1/2^10,1/2^10;2^10,2^10];
  [Ab,X]=balanc(A);
  norm(A(1,:))/norm(A(2,:))
  norm(Ab(1,:))/norm(Ab(2,:))
