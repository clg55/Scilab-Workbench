NAME
  scicos_graphics - Scicos block graphics data structure

DEFINITION
  graphics=list(orig,sz,flip,exprs,pin,pout,pein,peout,gr_i)

PARAMETERS

  orig : 2 x 1 vector, the coordinate of down-left point of the block shape.

  sz   : vector [w,h], where w is the width and h the height of the block
       shape.

  flip : boolean, the block orientation. if true the input ports are on the
       left of the box and output ports are on the right. if false  the input
       ports are on the right of the box and output ports are on the left.

  exprs
       : column vector of strings,  contains expressions answered by the user
       at block set time.

  pin  : column vector of integers. If pin(k)<>0 then  kth input port is con-
       nected to the pin(k)<>0 block, else the port is unconnected. If no
       input port exist pin==[].

  pout : column vector of integers.  If pout(k)<>0 then  kth output port is
       connected to the pout(k)<>0 block, else the port is unconnected. If no
       output port exist pout==[].

  pein : column vector of ones. If pein(k)<>0 then  kth event input port is
       connected to the pein(k)<>0 block, else the port is unconnected. If no
       event input port exist pein==[].

  peout
       : column vector of integers.  If peout(k)<>0 then  kth event output
       port is connected to the epout(k)<>0 block, else the port is uncon-
       nected. If no event  output port exist peout==[].

  gr_i : column vector of strings,  contains Scilab instructions used to cus-
       tomize the block graphical aspect. This field may be set with "Icon"
       sub_menu.

  graphics
       : Scilab list, Scicos block graphics data structure.

DESCRIPTION
  Scicos block graphics data structure contains all information relative to
  graphical display of the block and to user dialogue. Fields may be fixed by
  block definition or set as a result of user dialogue or connections.
