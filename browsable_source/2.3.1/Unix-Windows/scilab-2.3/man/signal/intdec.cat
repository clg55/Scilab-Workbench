intdec(1)                      Scilab Function                      intdec(1)
NAME
  intdec - Changes  sampling rate of a signal

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [y]=intdec(x,lom)

PARAMETERS

  x    : input sampled signal

  lom  : For a 1D signal this is a scalar which gives the rate change.  For a
       2D signal this is a 2-Vector of sampling rate changes lom=(col rate
       change,row rate change)

  y    : Output sampled signal

DESCRIPTION
  Changes the sampling rate of a 1D or 2D signal by the rates in lom
