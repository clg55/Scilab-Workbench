tlist(1)                       Scilab Function                       tlist(1)
NAME
  tlist - Scilab object and typed list definition.

CALLING SEQUENCE
  tlist(typ,a1,....an )

PARAMETERS

  typ       : Character string or vector of character strings

  ai        : any Scilab object (matrix, list,string...).

DESCRIPTION
  Creates a typed-list with elements ai's. The typ argument specifies the
  list type. Such typed-list allow the user to define new operations working
  on these object through scilab functions. The only difference between
  typed-list and list is the value of the type (16 instead of 15).

  typ(1) specifies the list type (character string used to define soft coded
  operations)

  if specified typ(i) may give the i+1th element formal name

  Standard Operations on list work similarly for typed-list:

  eexxttrraaccttiioonn
       : [x,y,z...]=l(v) where v is a vector of indices; [x,y,z]=l(:)
       extracts all the elements.

  iinnsseerrttiioonn
       : l(i)=a

  ddeelleettiioonn
       : l(i)=null() removes the i-th element of the tlist l.

  ddiissppllaayy

  Moreover if typ(2:n+1) are specified, user may point elements by their
  names

  We give below examples where tlist are used.

  Linear systems are represented by specific typed-list e.g. a linear system
  [A,B,C,D] is represented by the tlist
  Sys=tlist(['lss';'A';'B';'C';'D';'X';'td'],A,B,C,D,x0,'c') and this
  specific list may be created by the function syslin.

  Sys(2) or Sys('A') is the state-matrix and Sys('td') is the time domain
  A rational matrix H is represented by the typed-list
  H=tlist(['r';'num';'den';'td'],Num,Den,[]) where Num and Den are two poly-
  nomial matrices and a  (e.g. continuous time) linear system with transfer
  matrix H maybe created by syslin('c',H).
  H(2) or H('num') is the transfer matrix numerator
