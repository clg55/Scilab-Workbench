NAME
  ric_desc - Riccati equation

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [X1,X2,zero]=ric_desc(H,E)
  [X1,X2,zero]=ric_desc(H [,E])

PARAMETERS

  H,E         : real square matrices

  X1,X2       : real square matrices

  zero        : real number

DESCRIPTION
  Riccati solver with hamiltonian matrices as inputs.

  In the continuous time case calling sequence is (one input): ric_descr(H)

  Riccati equation is:
    (Ec)   A'*X + X*A + X*R*X -Q = 0.
  Defining the hamiltonian matrix H by:
   H = [A  R;
        Q -A']
  with the calling sequence [X1,X2,err]=ric_descr(H), the solution X is given
  by X=X1/X2.

  zero = L1 norm of rhs of (Ec)

  The solution X is also given by X=riccati(A,Q,R,'c'))

  In the discrete-time case calling sequence is (two inputs): ric_descr(H,E)

  The Riccati equation is:
     (Ed)  A'*X*A-(A'*X*B*(R+B'*X*B)^-1)*(B'*X*A)+C-X = 0.
  Defining G=B/R*B' and the hamiltonian pencil (E,H) by:
        E=[eye(n,n),G;               H=[A, 0*ones(n,n);
           0*ones(n,n),A']             -C, eye(n,n)];
  with the calling sequence [X1,X2,err]=ric_descr(H,E), the solution X is
  given by X=X1/X2.

  zero= L1 norm of rhs of (Ed)

  The solution X is also given by X=riccati(A,G,C,'d') with G=B/R*B'
