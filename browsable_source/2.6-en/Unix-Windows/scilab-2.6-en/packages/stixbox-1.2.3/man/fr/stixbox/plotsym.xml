  <DESCRIPTION>
  <P>
    Plot with symbols
    Input S is one of the following
  </P>
  <VERBATIM><![CDATA[
   's'  square           
          'd'  diamond
          't'  triangle
   'i'  inverted triangle
   'l'  left triangle
   'r'  right triangle
   'c'  circle
   ]]></VERBATIM>
  <P>
    In the longer call s is vector that contains category marker that is
    plotted with symbol from text string S, i.e element i is plotted with
    symbol S(s(i)), c is vector for colormarking, and C is corresponding
    string of &apos;rgbcymwk&apos; in permuted order. If C is omitted then c is
    taken as a colour in itself. The colors may then be changed by calling
    colormap. The input symsize defines the symbol size relative to the
    default size which is 1. It may be a scalar, which is then applied to
    all symbols, or a vector, one for each symbol.

    Examples:
  </P>
  <VERBATIM><![CDATA[
   plotsym(x,y,z,'st','rb')
   ]]></VERBATIM>
  <P>
    Points x,y are plotted with red squares (z=1) or blue triangles (z=2).
  </P>
  <VERBATIM><![CDATA[
   plotsym(x,y,'s',z,2)
   ]]></VERBATIM>
  <P>
    Points x,y are plotted with squares of twice the standard size, filled
    with colors according to value in z and current colormap.
