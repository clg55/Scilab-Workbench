             Computer Analysis of Multifactor Data", Second Edition, New
             York: John Wiley and Sons

Taken From:  Chatterjee and Hadi (1988), p. 259.

Dimension:   14 observations on 6 variables

Description: The data set is one of a sequence of several data sets taken
             at different times in an experimental study relating the heat
             evolved during hardening of 14 samples of cement to the
       composition of the cement. The explanatory variables are 
       weights (measured as percentages of the weight of each sample) 
       of five Clinker compounds. The dependant variable (heat) is 
       the last column in the data set.
