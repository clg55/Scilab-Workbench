//Dimension:   14 observations on 6 variables
// 
//Description: The data set is one of a sequence of several data sets taken
//             at different times in an experimental study relating the heat
//             evolved during hardening of 14 samples of cement to the
//	      composition of the cement. The explanatory variables are
//	      weights (measured as percentages of the weight of each sample)
//	      of five Clinker compounds. The dependant variable (heat) is
//	      the last column in the data set.
