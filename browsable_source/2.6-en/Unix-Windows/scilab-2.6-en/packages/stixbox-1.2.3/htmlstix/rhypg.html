Random numbers from the hypergeometric distribution <PRE>
	  (inversion method)

        X = rhypg(num,n,K,N)
	Input	num	positive integer or a 2-vector [lig, col] of 
			positive integers
		n,K,N   nonnegative integers such that 
			n&lt;= N, K&lt;= N and n-k&lt;= N-K	
			N is the total number of elements of the population
			n is the number of elements which are randomly
			  extracted
			K is the number of elements of the population which 
			  have the studied property
	Output 	X	num-vector or a num-matrix of random numbers 
			chosen from the hypergeometric distribution with 
			parameters n,K,N
