The hypergeometric inverse cdf<PRE>

        k = qhypg(p,n,K,N)

	Input	p	probability (scalar, vector or matrix)
		n,K,N   nonnegative integers such that 
			n&lt;= N, K&lt;= N and n-k&lt;= N-K	
			N is the total number of elements of the population
			n is the number of elements which are randomly
			  extracted
			K is the number of elements of the population which 
			  have the studied property

	Output  k	for each p, k is the smallest integer j so
			 that P(X &lt;= j) >= p.
