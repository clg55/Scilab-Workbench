Fit a logistic regression model.<PRE>

     	  [b, Ib, Vb] = logitfit(y,X,C)

	  Fit the model log(p/(1-p)) = X*b, where p is the probability 
	  that y is 1 and not 0. Output b is vector of point estimates,  
	  Ib is confidence intervals, and Vb is the estimated variance 
	  matrix of b. Input C is confidence level for the confidence 
	  intervals, default is 0.95.

         If an intercept is not included in X it is automatically added 
         as an extra column.

	  See also LODDS and LODDSINV.
