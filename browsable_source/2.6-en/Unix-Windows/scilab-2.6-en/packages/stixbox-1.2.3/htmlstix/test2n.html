<DD>
Tests and confidence intervals based on two normal samples<PRE>
         with common variance.
         
         [pval, cidiffmean, cisigma] = test2n(x,y,CL)

         Input  x,y samples (column vectors)
                CL   confidence level for the confidence intervals
                                                  (default 0.95). 

         Output pval probability that Student statistic based on x and y
                     is as far from 0 as it is actually, or further away 
                     under hypothesis that theoretical means are equal.
                cdiffmean  confidence interval for the difference of means.
                cisigma    confidence interval for the standard deviation.
            
 (Confidence intervals of the form [LeftLimit, PointEstimate, RightLimit]).
