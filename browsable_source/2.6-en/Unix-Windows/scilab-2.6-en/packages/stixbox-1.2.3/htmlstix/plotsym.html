Plot with symbols<PRE>

	  plotsym(x,y,S)
	  plotsym(x,y,s,S,c,C,symsize)

	  Input S is one of the following

	  's'  square           
         'd'  diamond
         't'  triangle
	  'i'  inverted triangle
	  'l'  left triangle
	  'r'  right triangle
	  'c'  circle
	
	  In the longer call s is vector that contains category marker that
	  is plotted with symbol from text string S, i.e element i is 
	  plotted with symbol S(s(i)), c is vector for colormarking, and
	  C is corresponding string of 'rgbcymwk' in permuted order. If C
	  is omitted then c is taken as a colour in itself. The colors
	  may then be changed by calling colormap. The input symsize 
	  defines the symbol size relative to the default size which is 1.
	  It may be a scalar, which is then applied to all symbols, or a 
	  vector, one for each symbol. Examples:

	  plotsym(x,y,z,'st','rb')
	     Points x,y are plotted with red squares (z=1) or blue
	     triangles (z=2).

	  plotsym(x,y,'s',z,2)
	     Points x,y are plotted with squares of twice the standard 
	     size, filled with colors according to value in z and current 
	     colormap.

	  Note: in Matlab 5.x the built in plot function now has similar
	  functionality.
