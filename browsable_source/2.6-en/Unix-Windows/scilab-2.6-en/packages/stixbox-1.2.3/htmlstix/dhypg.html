The hypergeometric probability function<PRE>

        p = dhypg(k,n,K,N)
	Input	k,n,K,N nonnegative integers such that 
			n&lt;= N, K&lt;= N and n-k&lt;= N-K	
			N is the total number of elements of the population
			n is the number of elements which are randomly
			  extracted
			K is the number of elements of the population which 
			  have the studied property

	Output  p	probability Prob(X=k) where X is an hypergeometric
			random variable with parameters n,K,N
