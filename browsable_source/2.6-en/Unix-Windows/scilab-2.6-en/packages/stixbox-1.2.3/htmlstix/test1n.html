Tests and confidence intervals based on a normal sample<PRE>
         
         [pval, cimean, cisigma] = test1n(x,CL)
         
         Input  x    sample (column vector)
                CL   confidence level for the confidence intervals
                                                  (default 0.95). 

         Output pval probability that Student variate based on x
                     is as far from 0 as it is actually, or further away 
                     under hypothesis that theoretical mean is 0.
                cimean  confidence interval for the mean.
                cisigma confidence interval for the standard deviation.

 (Confidence intervals of the form [LeftLimit, PointEstimate, RightLimit]).
