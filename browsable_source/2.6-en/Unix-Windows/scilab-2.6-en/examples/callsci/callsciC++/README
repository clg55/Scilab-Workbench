	How to make calls to Scilab interpreter 
	from a C++ program 
	(Unix only since the proper Makefiles for windows 
	are not still writen) 
	
In this directory we provide small examples of C++ calls to the Scilab 
interpreter. 

To make it run you have to edit the Makefile 
and change the SCIDIR variable to fit your local Scilab installation 

Then type 
	make distclean 
	make all 
	./myprog 

Note: The whole process should work under Windows but the Windows 
	Makefiles remain to be writen 

That's all
