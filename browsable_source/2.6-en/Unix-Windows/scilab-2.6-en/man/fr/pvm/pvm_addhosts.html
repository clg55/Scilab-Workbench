    <H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
    <ul>
  <p>
    <tt>
          <b>pvm_addhosts</b>
        </tt>
    adds the computers named in
  </p>
  <p>
    to the configuration of computers making up the virtual machine.
    The names should have the same syntax as lines of a pvmd hostfile
    (see man page for pvmd3):
    A hostname followed by options of the form xx=y.
  </p>
  <p>
    The array
  </p>
  <p>
    can be checked to determine the status for each host.
    Values less than zero indicate an error,
    while positive values are TIDs of the new hosts.
  </p>
  <p>
    The status of hosts can be requested by the application using
     <tt>
          <b>pvm_config</b>
        </tt>.
    If a host fails it will be automatically deleted from the configuration.
    Using pvm_addhosts a replacement host can be added by the application,
    however
    it is the responsibility of the
    application developer to make his application tolerant of host failure.
    Another use of this feature would be to add more hosts
    as they become available, for example on a weekend, or if the
    application dynamically determines it could use more computational power.
