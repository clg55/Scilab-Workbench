  <DESCRIPTION>
  <P>
    <VERB>pvm_probe</VERB> 
    checks to see if a message with  label
         msgtag  has  arrived  from  tid.  If  a matching message has
         arrived pvm_probe returns a buffer identifier in bufid. This
         bufid  can be used in a pvm_bufinfo call to determine infor-
         mation about the message such as its source and length.
  </P>
  <P>
         If the requested message has  not  arrived,  then  pvm_probe
         returns  with  a 0 in bufid. If some error occurs bufid will
         be &lt; 0.
  </P>
  <P>
         A -1 in msgtag or tid matches  anything.   This  allows  the
         user  the  following  options.   If  tid  = -1 and msgtag is
         defined by the user, then pvm_probe will  accept  a  message
         from  any  process which has a matching msgtag.  If msgtag =
         -1 and tid is defined  by  the  user,  then  pvm_probe  will
         accept  any message that is sent from process tid.  If tid =
         -1 and msgtag = -1, then pvm_probe will accept  any  message
         from any process.
  </P>
  <P>
         pvm_probe can be called multiple times to check if  a  given
         message  has  arrived  yet.  After  the message has arrived,
         pvm_recv must be called before the message can  be  unpacked
         into the user&apos;s memory using the unpack routines.
