    <H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
    <ul>
  <p>
    This block is a regular split block with an input and two outputs. The
    outputs reproduces the input port on each output ports. 
    Strictly speaking, SPLIT is not a Scicos block because it is
    discarded at the compilation phase. This block is automatically
    created when creating a new link issued from a link.
  </p>
  <p>
    Port sizes are determined by the context.
