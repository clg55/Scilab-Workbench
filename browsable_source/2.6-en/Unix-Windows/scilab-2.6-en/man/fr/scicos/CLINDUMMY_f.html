      <ul>CLINDUMMY_f -  Scicos dummy continuous system with state  </ul>

    <H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
    <ul>
  <p>
    This block should be placed in any block diagram that contains a
    zero-crossing block but no continuous system with state. The reason 
    for that is that it is the ode solver that find zero crossing
    surfaces.
