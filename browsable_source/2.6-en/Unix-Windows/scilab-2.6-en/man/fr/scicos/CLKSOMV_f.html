      <ul>CLKSOMV_f -  Scicos event addition block  </ul>
    </p>
    <H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
    <ul>
  <p>
    This block is an event addition block with up to three inputs. The
    output reproduces 
    the events on all the input ports. Strictly speaking, CLKSOMV is not a
    Scicos block because it is discarded at the compilation phase. The
    inputs and output of CLKSOMV are synchronized.
