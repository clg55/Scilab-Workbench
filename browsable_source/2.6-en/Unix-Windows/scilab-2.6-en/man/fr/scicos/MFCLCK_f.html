    <p>
      <ul>MFCLCK_f -  Scicos basic block for frequency division of event clock  </ul>
    </p>
    <H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
    <ul>
  <p>
    This block is used in the Super Block MCLOCK. The input event is
    directed once every n times to output 1 and the rest of the time
    to output 2. There is a delay of "Basic period" in the transmission
    of the event. If this period &gt;0 then the second output is initially
    fired. It is not if this period=0. In the latter case, the input
    is driven by an event clock and in the former case, feedback can
    be used.
