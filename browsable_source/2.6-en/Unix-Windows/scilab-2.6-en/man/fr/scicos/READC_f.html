    <H3>NAME </H3>
    <p>
      <ul>READC_f -  Scicos "read from C binary file" block   </ul>
    </p>
    <H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
    <ul>
  <p>
    This block allows user to read datas in a C file.  <tt>
          <b>Output record
    selection</b>
        </tt> and <tt>
          <b>Time record Selection</b>
        </tt> allows the user to select
    data among file records.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each call to the block advance one record in the file. 
  </p>
  </ul>
    <H3>DIALOGUE PARAMETERS</H3>
    <ul>
      <li>Time record Selection
: an empty matrix or a positive integer. If an integer  is given the  th element of the read record is assumed to be the date of the output event. If empty no output event exists.

  </li>
      <li>Output record selection
: a vector of positive integer. ,The th element of  the read record gives the value of th output.

  </li>
      <li>Input file name
: a character string defining the path of the file 

  </li>
      <li>Input Format
: a character string defining the  format to use 

  </li>
      <li>"l","s","ul","us","d","f","c","uc"
: for reading  respectively  long, ashort, unsigned long,  unsigned short, double,  float,  char and  unsigned char. If required by the , the bytes which are read are automatically swapped if necessary (by checking little-endian status) in order to produce machine independent binary files ( in little-endian mode).

  </li>
      <li>"ull","uls","ubl","ubs",
: can be used for reading respectively unsigned little-endian long or short and unsigned big-endian long or short. 

  </li>
      <li>"dx","fx","lx","sx"
: with  or  can be used for reading double, float, long or short as big or little endian.

  </li>
      <li>Record size
: The file is supposed to be formed by a sequence  of data with same format. these data are organized in a sequence of record each of them containing  data.

  </li>
      <li>Buffer size
: To improve efficiency it is possible to buffer the input data. read on the file is only done after each  call to the block.

  </li>
      <li>Initial record index
: a scalar. This fixes the first record of the file to use.

  </li>
      <li>Swap mode
: With   the file is supposed to be coded in "little endian IEEE format" and data are swaped if necessary to match the IEEE format of the processor. If   then automatic bytes swap is disabled.

  </li>
