      <ul>WRITEC_f -  Scicos "write to C binary file" block   </ul>
    </p>
    <H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
    <ul>
  <p>
    This block allows user to write datas in a C binary file.

    <H3>DIALOGUE PARAMETERS</H3>
    <ul>
      <li>Input size
: a scalar, the size of the input

  </li>
      <li>Output file name
: a character string defining the path of the file 

  </li>
      <li>Output Format
: a character string defining the  format to use 

  </li>
      <li>"l","s","ul","us","d","f","c","uc"
: for reading  respectively  long, ashort, unsigned long,  unsigned short, double,  float,  char and  unsigned char. If required by the , the bytes which are read are automatically swapped if necessary (by checking little-endian status) in order to produce machine independent binary files ( in little-endian mode).

  </li>
      <li>"ull","uls","ubl","ubs",
: can be used for reading respectively unsigned little-endian long or short and unsigned big-endian long or short. 

  </li>
      <li>"dx","fx","lx","sx"
: with  or  can be used for reading double, float, long or short as big or little endian.

  </li>
      <li>Buffer size
: To improve efficiency it is possible to buffer the input data. read on the file is only done after each  call to the block. 

  </li>
      <li>Swap mode
: With   the file is supposed to be coded in "little endian IEEE format" and data are swaped if necessary to match the IEEE format of the processor. If   then automatic bytes swap is disabled.

  </li>
