    <H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
    <ul>
  <p>
    This block realizes a continuous-time linear state-space system
    with the possibility of jumps in the state. The number of inputs
    to this block is two. The first input is the regular input of the
    linear system, the second carries the new value of the state which
    is copied into the state when an event arrives at the unique event 
    input port of this block. That means the state of the system jumps 
    to the value present on the second input (of size equal to that of
    the state).
    The system is defined by the (A,B,C,D) matrices and the initial
    state x0. The dimensions must be compatible. The sizes of inputs
    and outputs are adjusted automatically.
