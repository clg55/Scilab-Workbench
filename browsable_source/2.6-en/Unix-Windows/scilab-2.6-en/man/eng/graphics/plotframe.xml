  <PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_NAME>rect  </PARAM_NAME>
  <PARAM_DESCRIPTION>
    : vector <VERB>[xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax]</VERB>.
  </PARAM_DESCRIPTION> 
  </PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_NAME>tics  </PARAM_NAME>
  <PARAM_DESCRIPTION>
    : vector <VERB>[nx,mx,ny,my]</VERB> where <VERB>mx, nx</VERB> (resp. <VERB>my, ny</VERB>) are the number of x-axis (resp. y-axis) intervals and subintervals.
  </PARAM_DESCRIPTION> 
  </PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_NAME>arg_optX  </PARAM_NAME>
  <PARAM_DESCRIPTION>
    : optional arguments up to three and choosen among.
  </PARAM_DESCRIPTION> 
  </PARAM_ITEM>
 <PARAM_INDENT>
  <PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_NAME>flags  </PARAM_NAME>
  <PARAM_DESCRIPTION>
    : vector <VERB>[wantgrids,findbounds]</VERB> where <VERB>wantgrids</VERB> is a boolean variable (<VERB>%t</VERB> or <VERB>%f</VERB>) which indicates gridding. <VERB>findbounds</VERB> is a boolean variable. If <VERB>findbounds</VERB> is <VERB>%t</VERB>, the bounds given in <VERB>rect</VERB> are allowed to be slightly modified  (in fact always increased) in order to have simpler graduations: then <VERB>tics(2)</VERB> and  <VERB>tics(4)</VERB> are ignored.
  </PARAM_DESCRIPTION> 
  </PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_NAME>captions  </PARAM_NAME>
  <PARAM_DESCRIPTION>
    : vector of 3 strings <VERB>[title,x-leg,y-leg]</VERB> corresponding respectively to the title of the plot and the captions on the x-axis and the y-axis.
  </PARAM_DESCRIPTION> 
  </PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_NAME>subwin  </PARAM_NAME>
  <PARAM_DESCRIPTION>
    : a vector of size 4 defining the sub window. The sub window is specified with the  parameter <VERB>subwin=[x,y,w,h]</VERB> (upper-left, width, height).  The values in <VERB>subwin</VERB> are specified using proportion of the width  or height of the current graphics window (see <VERB>xsetech</VERB>).

  <DESCRIPTION>
  <P>
    <VERB>plotframe</VERB> is used with 2D plotting functions <VERB>plot2d</VERB>,
    <VERB>plot2d1</VERB>,... to set a graphics frame. It must be
    used before <VERB>plot2d</VERB> which should be invoked with
    the &quot;000&quot; superposition mode.
