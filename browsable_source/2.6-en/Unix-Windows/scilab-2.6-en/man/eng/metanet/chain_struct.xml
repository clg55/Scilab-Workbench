  <DESCRIPTION>
  <P>
    <VERB>chain_struct</VERB> computes the row vectors of the edge chained structure 
    description of the graph <VERB>g</VERB>.
    It is also possible to give directly <VERB>chain_struct</VERB> the adjacency lists of
    the graph. This is more efficient if the adjacency lists are already
    available since <VERB>chain_struct</VERB> uses them to make computations.
  </P>
  <P>
    The vectors <VERB>fe</VERB>, <VERB>che</VERB>, <VERB>fn</VERB> and <VERB>chn</VERB> describe the
    chained structure in the following way:
  </P>
  <P>
    <VERB>fe(i))</VERB> is the number of the first edge starting from node i
  </P>
  <P>
    <VERB>che(fe(i))</VERB> is the number of the second edge starting from
    node i, <VERB>che(che(fe(i)))</VERB> is the number of the third edge starting from
    node i and so on until the value is 0
  </P>
  <P>
    <VERB>fn(i)</VERB> is the number of the first node reached from node i
  </P>
  <P>
    <VERB>ch(i)</VERB> is the number of the node reached by edge <VERB>che(i)</VERB>.
  </P>
