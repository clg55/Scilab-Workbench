      <ul>intersci  -  scilab tool to interface C of Fortran functions with scilab  </ul>
    </p>
    <H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
    <ul>
  <p>
    All scilab primitive functions are defined in a set of interface
    routines. For each function the interfacing code checks first number of
    rhs and lhs arguments. Then  it get pointers on input arguments in the
    Scilab data base and checks their types. After that it calls procedure
    associated with Scilab functions, checks returned errors flags and set
    the results in the data base.

  <p>
    <tt>
          <b>intersci</b>
        </tt>\ is a program which permits to interface automatically FORTRAN 
    subroutines or C functions to Scilab
  </p>
  <p>
    With <tt>
          <b>intersci</b>
        </tt>, a user can group all his FORTRAN or C code into a same set,
    called an interface, and use them in Scilab as Scilab functions. The interfacing
    is made by creating a FORTRAN subroutine which has to be linked to
    Scilab  together 
    with the user code. This complex FORTRAN subroutine is automatically generated
    by <tt>
          <b>intersci</b>
        </tt>\ from a description file of the interface.
