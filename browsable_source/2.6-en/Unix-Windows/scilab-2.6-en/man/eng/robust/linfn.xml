  <DESCRIPTION>
  <P>
    Computes the Linf (or Hinf) norm of <VERB>G</VERB>
    This norm is well-defined as soon as the realization
    <VERB>G=(A,B,C,D)</VERB> has no imaginary eigenvalue which is both 
    controllable and observable.
  </P>
  <P>
    <VERB>freq</VERB> is a list of the frequencies for which <VERB>||G||</VERB> is 
    attained,i.e., such that <VERB>||G (j om)|| = ||G||</VERB>.
  </P>
  <P>
    If -1 is in the list, the norm is attained at infinity.
  </P>
  <P>
    If -2 is in the list, <VERB>G</VERB> is all-pass in some direction so that 
    <VERB>||G (j omega)|| = ||G||</VERB> for all frequencies omega.
  </P>
  <P>
    The algorithm follows the paper by G. Robel 
    (AC-34 pp. 882-884, 1989).
    The case <VERB>D=0</VERB> is not treated separately due to superior 
    accuracy of the general method when <VERB>(A,B,C)</VERB> is nearly 
    non minimal.
  </P>
  <P>
    The <VERB>&apos;trace&apos;</VERB> option traces each bisection step, i.e., displays 
    the lower and upper bounds and the current test point.
  </P>
  <P>
    The <VERB>&apos;cond&apos;</VERB> option estimates a confidence index on the computed 
    value and issues a warning if computations are 
    ill-conditioned
  </P>
  <P>
    In the general case (<VERB>A</VERB> neither stable nor anti-stable), 
    no upper bound is  prespecified. 
  </P>
  <P>
    If by contrast <VERB>A</VERB> is stable or anti stable, lower
    and upper bounds are computed using the associated 
    Lyapunov solutions.
