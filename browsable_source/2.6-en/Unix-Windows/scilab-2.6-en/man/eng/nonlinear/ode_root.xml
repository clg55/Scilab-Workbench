  <DESCRIPTION>
  <P>
    With this syntax (first argument equal to <VERB>&quot;root&quot;</VERB>)
    <VERB>ode</VERB>
    computes the solution
    of the differential equation <VERB>dy/dt=f(t,y)</VERB> until the state
    <VERB>y(t)</VERB> crosses the surface <VERB>g(t,y)=0</VERB>.
  </P>
  <P>
    <VERB>g</VERB> should give the equation of the surface.
    It is an external i.e. a function with
    specified syntax, or the name of a Fortran subroutine or a C function 
    (character string) with specified calling sequence or a list.
  </P>
  <P>
    If <VERB>g</VERB> is a function the syntax should be as follows:
  </P>
  <VERBATIM><![CDATA[
z=g(t,y)
   ]]></VERBATIM>
  <P>
    where <VERB>t</VERB> is a real scalar (time)  and <VERB>y</VERB> a real vector (state).
    It returns a vector of size <VERB>ng</VERB> which corresponds to 
    the <VERB>ng</VERB> constraints. 
    If <VERB>g</VERB> is a character string it refers to the name of a Fortran
    subroutine or a C function, with the following calling sequence: 
    <VERB>g(n,t,y,ng,gout)</VERB>
    where <VERB>ng</VERB> is the number of constraints and 
    <VERB>gout</VERB> is the value of <VERB>g</VERB> (output of the program).
    If <VERB>g</VERB> is a list the same conventions as for <VERB>f</VERB> apply (see ode
    help).
  </P>
  <P>
    Ouput <VERB>rd</VERB> is a <VERB>1 x k</VERB> vector. The first entry contains the stopping
    time. Other entries indicate which components of <VERB>g</VERB> have changed
    sign. <VERB>k</VERB> larger than 2 indicates that more than one surface
    (<VERB>(k-1)</VERB> surfaces) have been simultaneously traversed.
  </P>
  <P>
    Other arguments and other options are the same as for <VERB>ode</VERB>, see the
    ode help.
  </P>
