    <H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
    <ul>
  <p>
    <tt>
          <b>pvm_exit</b>
        </tt> tells the local pvmd
    that this process is leaving PVM.
    This routine does not kill the process, which can continue to
    perform tasks just like any other serial process.
  </p>
  <p>
    pvm_exit should be called by all PVM processes before
    they stop or exit for good. It <tt>
          <b>must</b>
        </tt> be called
    by processes that were not started with pvm_spawn.
