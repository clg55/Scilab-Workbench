    <H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
    <ul>
  <p>
    <tt>
          <b>pvm_bcast</b>
        </tt> broadcasts a message to all the members of
  </p>
  <p>
    In PVM 3.2 and later the broadcast message is not sent back to the sender.
    Any PVM task can call pvm_bcast(), it need not be a member of the group.
    The content of the message can be distinguished by
  </p>
  <p>
    If pvm_bcast is successful,
  </p>
  <p>
    will be 0. If some error occurs then
  </p>
  <p>
    will be &lt; 0.
  </p>
  <p>
    pvm_bcast is asynchronous.
    Computation on the sending processor resumes as soon as the message is
    safely on its way to the receiving processors.  This is in
    contrast to synchronous communication, during which computation on
    the sending processor halts until a matching receive is
    executed by all the receiving processors.
  </p>
  <p>
    pvm_bcast first determines the tids of the
    group members by checking a group data base.
    A multicast is performed to these tids.
    If the group is changed during a broadcast the change will not
    be reflected in the broadcast.
    Multicasting is not supported by most multiprocessor vendors.
    Typically their native calls only support broadcasting to <tt>
          <b>all</b>
        </tt>
    the user's processes on a multiprocessor. Because of this omission,
    pvm_bcast may not be an efficient communication method on
    some multiprocessors.
