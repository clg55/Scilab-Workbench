          see the corresponding behaviour). If <VERB>flag</VERB> is missing,
          <VERB>ebox</VERB> is not taken into acoount. Note that, when
          specified, the <VERB>ebox</VERB> argument acts on the

  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P><VERB>param3d</VERB> is used to plot a 3D curve defined by its
    coordinates <VERB>x</VERB>, <VERB>y</VERB> and <VERB>z</VERB>. Note that
    data can also be set or get through the surface entity properties (see
    <LINK>surface_properties</LINK>).</P>

    <P>Note that properties like <VERB>rotation angles</VERB>,
    <VERB>colors</VERB> and <VERB>thickness</VERB> of the plotted curves can
    also be set through the param3d entity properties (see
    <LINK>param3d_properties</LINK>).</P>

    <P>Use <VERB>param3d1</VERB> to do multiple plots.</P>

    <P>Enter the command <VERB>param3d()</VERB> to see a demo.</P>
