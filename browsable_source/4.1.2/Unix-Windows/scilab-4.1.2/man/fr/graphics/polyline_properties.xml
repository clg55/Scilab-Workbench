  entity properties</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>The Polyline entity is a leaf of the graphics entities hierarchy. This
    entity defines the parameters for polylines.</P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="parent: ">
        <SP>This field contains the handle of the parent. The parent of the
        polyline entity should be of the type <VERB>"Axes"</VERB> or
        <VERB>"Compound"</VERB>.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="children: ">
        <SP>This property contains a vector with the <VERB>children</VERB> of
        the handle. However, polyline handles currently do not have any
        <VERB>children</VERB>.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="visible: ">
        <SP>This field contains the <VERB>visible</VERB> property value for
        the entity . It should be <VERB>"on" </VERB> or <VERB>"off"</VERB> .
        By default, the polyline is visible, the value's property is
        <VERB>"on" </VERB>. If <VERB>"off"</VERB> the polyline is not drawn on
        the screen.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="closed: ">
        <SP>This field determines wether the polyline is closed or not: its
        value can be <VERB>"on"</VERB> or <VERB>"off"</VERB> (no default
        value, it depends on the primitive used to create the polyline).</SP>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="line_mode: ">
        <SP>This field contains the default <VERB>line_mode</VERB> property
        value for the polyline. Its value should be <VERB>"on" </VERB>(line
        drawn) or <VERB>"off"</VERB> (no line drawn).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="fill_mode: ">
        <SP>If the <VERB>polyline_style</VERB> field is different of 5, fill
        the background of the curve with color defined by the
        <VERB>background</VERB> property.</SP>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="line_style: ">
        <SP>The <VERB>line_style</VERB> property value should be an integer in
        [1 6]. 1 stands for solid the other value stands for a selection of

      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="polyline_style: ">
        <SP>This property sets several polyline drawing mode:</SP>

        <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
          <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
            <SP>If the value is 0 or 1 lines are drawn between two

          </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

          <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
            <SP>If the value is 2 the polyline produces a staircase plot. Two

          </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

          <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

        </DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="foreground: ">
        <SP>This field contains the default <VERB>foreground</VERB> property
        used to draw the polyline. Its value should be a color index (relative
        to the current colormap).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="background: ">
        <SP>This field contains the color used to fill the background of the
        polyline. Its value should be a color index (relative to the current
        colormap).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="interp_color_vector: ">
        <SP>This field contains the vector of color indices used to fill in
        the polyline when the <VERB>interp_color_mode</VERB> property is set
        to <VERB>"on"</VERB>. It defines the intervals of colormap indices
        used to fill each segment. For instance, the first segment will be
        filled by every colors whose index is between the first two elements
        of the vecor. It is only applicable if the polyline is defined by 3 or
        4 points. Therefore, the size of the vector must match this
        dimension.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="interp_color_mode: ">
        <SP>This field determines if we are using the interpolated shading
        mode to fill the polyline : its value can be <VERB>"on"</VERB> or
        <VERB>"off"</VERB>. Note that an <VERB>interp_color_vector</VERB> must
        be defined before switching to "on" value (see above).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_mode: ">
        <SP>This field contains the default <VERB>mark_mode</VERB> property
        value for the polyline. Its value should be <VERB>"on"</VERB> (marks
        drawn) or <VERB>"off"</VERB> (no marks drawn).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_style: ">
        <SP>The <VERB>mark_style</VERB> property value is used to select the
        type of mark to use when <VERB>mark_mode</VERB> property is
        <VERB>"on"</VERB>. The value should be an integer in [0 14] which
        stands for: dot, plus, cross, star, filled diamond, diamond, triangle
        up, triangle down, diamond plus, circle, asterisk, square, triangle
        right, triangle left and pentagram.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_size_unit: ">
        <SP>This field contains the default <VERB>mark_size_unit</VERB>
        property value. If <VERB>mark_size_unit</VERB> is set to
        <VERB>"point"</VERB>, then the <VERB>mark_size</VERB> value is
        directly given in points. When <VERB>mark_size_unit</VERB> is set to
        <VERB>"tabulated"</VERB>, <VERB>mark_size</VERB> is computed relative
        to the font size array: therefore, its value should be an integer in
        [0 5] which stands for 8pt, 10pt, 12pt, 14pt, 18pt and 24pt. Note that
        <LINK>plot2d</LINK> and pure scilab functions use
        <VERB>tabulated</VERB> mode as default ; when using <LINK>plot</LINK>
        function, the <VERB>point</VERB> mode is automatically enabled.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_size: ">
        <SP>The <VERB>mark_size</VERB> property is used to select the type of
        size of the marks when <VERB>mark_mode</VERB> property is
        <VERB>"on"</VERB>. Its value should be an integer between 0 and 5
        whith stands for 8pt, 10pt, 12pt, 14pt, 18pt and 24pt.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_foreground: ">
        <SP>This field contains the <VERB>mark_foreground</VERB> property
        value which is the marks' edge color. Its value should be a color

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_background: ">
        <SP>This field contains the <VERB>mark_background</VERB> property
        value which is the marks' face color. Its value should be a color
        index (relative to the current color_map).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="x_shift: ">
        <SP>This field contains the offset computed by a call to the
        <LINK>bar</LINK> function (or re-computed by a call to
        <LINK>barhomogenize</LINK>) and is used to perform a nice vertical bar
        representation. Note that this offset is also taken into account for
        all the other <VERB>polyline_style</VERB>. The unit is expressed in
        user coordinates.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="y_shift: ">

        <LINK>bar</LINK> function (or re-computed by a call to
        <LINK>barhomogenize</LINK>) and is used to perform a nice horizontal
        bar representation. Note that this offset is also taken into account
        for all the other <VERB>polyline_style</VERB>. The unit is expressed
        in user coordinates.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="z_shift: ">
        <SP>This field contains the offset the user may specify. Note that

      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="bar_width: ">
        <SP>This field determines the width of the selected polyline when its
        <VERB>polyline_style</VERB> is set to bar mode (case 6) : the unit is
        expressed in user coordinates.</SP>

        Other cases the vector <VERB>[x,y,w,h]</VERB> (upper-left point width
        height) defines the portions of the polyline to display, however
        <VERB>clip_state</VERB> property value will be changed.</SP>
