This directory contains utility functions:

The Fortran routine newfun.f
    generates the source code of the scilab routine
    funtab.f (This last routine is the the scilab directory 
    routines/"default" and a copy of it is in this directory).
    newfun takes the two files fundef and funtab.f and from these
    two files it makes the file funtab.f.new which is the new source code
    of funtab.f. This new funtab.f manages all the primitives defined
    in fundef. fundef is a three columns table: first column = name
    of a primitive  second column = internal coding in scilab third column=
    type of primitive (0 low-level, 1 system function, 2 macro-like primitive)


The Fortran routine callsci.f 
    is an example of calling scilab as a subroutine of a user's Fortran main
    program (callsci.f).
    This main program send matrices (call matz) and commands 
    (call matlab) to scilab and gets the results back (call matz).
