.SH NAME
xsetech - set the subwindow of a graphic window to use for graphics
.SH CALLING SEQUENCE
.nf
[]=xsetech(wrect [,frect])
.fi
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP 10
wrect
: a vector of size 4 (subwindow definition)
.TP 10
frect
: a vector of size 4 (just like the rect argument of \fVplot2d\fR )
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This function is mainly used to set the subwindow of the graphic window 
which will be used for graphics. The subwindow is specified with the 
parameter \fVwrect=[x,y,w,h]\fR ( Upper-Left Width Height ). 
The values in \fVwrect\fR are specified using proportion of the width 
or height of the current graphic window. for example 
.LP
\fVwrect=[0,0,1.0,1.0]\fR means that all the graphic window will be used.
.LP
\fVwrect=[0.5,0,0.5,1.0]\fR means that the graphic region will be the right 
half of the graphic window.
.LP This function also set the current graphic scales for 2D plottings
and can be used in conjunction whith graphic routines which request
the current graphic scale (for example \fVstrf="x0y"\fR in \fVplot2d\fR ).
\fVfrect=[xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax]\fR is used to set the graphic scale and 
is just like the \fVrect\fR argument of \fVplot2d\fR. Its default value 
is \fV[0,0,1,1]\fR.
.SH EXAMPLE
In this first example xsetech is used to split the graphic window 
in two parts 
.nf 

// xsetech is used to fix the first subwindow 
// and the graphic scale 
xsetech([0,0,1.0,0.5],[-5,-3,5,3]);
// then we call plot2d with the "001" option to use the graphic scale 
// set by xsetech 
plot2d((1:10)',(1:10)',-1,"001",' ');
// xsetech is used to fix the second subwindow 
xsetech([0,0.5,1.0,0.5]);
// the graphic scale is set by xsetech to [0,0,1,1] by defaut 
// and we change it with the use of the rect argument in plot2d 
plot2d((1:10)',(1:10)',-1,"011",' ',[-6,-6,6,6]);

.fi 
A second example with four graphics on a single graphic window 
.nf 

xset("font',2,0);
xsetech([0,0,0.5,0.5]);plot3d();
xsetech([0.5,0,0.5,0.5]);plot2d();
xsetech([0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5]);grayplot();
xsetech([0,0.5,0.5,0.5]);histplot();
// back to default values for the subwindow 
xsetech([0,0,1,1]);
xset("default');
