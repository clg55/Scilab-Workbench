.SH NAME
fac3d - complex 3D surface plotting
.SH CALLING SEQUENCE
.nf
fac3d(x,y,z,theta,alpha,leg,flag,ebox)
fac3d(x,y,z,theta,alpha,leg,[flag,ebox)]
.fi
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP 15
x,y,z
: matrices of sizes (nf,n1) (facets coordinates)
.TP 15
theta, alpha 
: real values giving in degree the spherical coordinates of 
the observation point
.TP
leg 
: string (captions for each axis. this is string 
with @ as a field separator, for example : "X@Y@Z")
.TP
flag
: is a real vector of size three \fVflag=[mode,type,box]\fR or a
list of size three flag=list(color,type,box)
.RS 
.TP
mode 
: string (treatment of hidden parts)
.RS
.TP 
mode >=2
the hidden parts of the surface are removed and the surface is painted 
in gray (from low gray to black according to the value of mode)
.TP
mode = 1
the hidden parts of the surface are drawn 
.TP
mode <= 0
only the shadow of the surface is painted with a gray level depending
on mode
.RE
.TP
type 
: scaling
.RS 
.TP 15
if type = 0
the plot is made using the current 3D scaling ( set by a previous call to
\fVparam3d, fac3d, contour, plot3d1\fR)
.TP
if type = 1
the boundaries are specified by the value of the parameter
.LP
\fVebox=[xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax,zmin,zmax]\fR
.TP
else
the boundaries are computed with the given datas.
.RE
.TP
box
: frame display around the plot.
.RS
.TP
box=0 
nothing is drawn around the plot
.TP
box=1 
unimplemented ( like box=0 )
.TP
box=2 
only the axes behind the surface are drawn
.TP
box=3 
a box surrounding the surface is drawn and captions are added
.TP
box=4
a box surrounding the surface is drawn, captions are added and axes too.
.RE
.RE 
.TP 10
color : a n1 vector of color indices 
.SH DESCRIPTION
Draw the surface  defined by a set of facets of coordinates 
x(:,i), y(:,i), z(:,i)
.SH EXAMPLE
enter the command  \fVfac3d()\fR
to see a demo
