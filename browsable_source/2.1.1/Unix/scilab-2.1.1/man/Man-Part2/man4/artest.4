.SH NAME
artest - arnold dynamical system
.SH CALLING SEQUENCE 
.nf
artest(f_l,[odem,xdim,npts])
arnold(t,x)
iarf([a])
.fi
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
f_l 
: can be "arnold" or arnold. it is the name of the external for the arnold system.
"arnold" will use a Fortran coded version where a(1:6)=1 and arnold will 
use a Scilab coded version. arnold is a Scilab macro coding the arnold
system. This macro is loaded when calling artest.
.TP
iarf 
: is used to fix the values of a in the Scilab coded case. a is a vector of size 6
.TP
odem,xdim,npts 
: are optional arguments. Their meaning and syntax can be found in the portr3d  help
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
artest is used for the integration of the following dynamical system
.nf
      ydot(1)=a(1)*cos(y(2)) +a(2)*sin(y(3))
      ydot(2)=a(3)*cos(y(3)) +a(4)*sin(y(1))
      ydot(3)=a(5)*cos(y(1)) +a(6)*sin(y(2))
