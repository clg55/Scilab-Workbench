This directory contains examples of C and Fortran interface routines
dynamically linked with scilab by the addinter command.

The source code of the interfaced routines are found in directory "src"

For example, the Fortran subroutine src/foubare2f.f is interfaced with Scilab
by the interface program Exemplf.f. It is called from
Scilab by function [x,y,z,t]=foubare('flag',a,b,c).

The C routine src/foubare2c.c is interfaced with Scilab
by the interface program Exemplc.c. It is called from
Scilab by function [x,y,z,t]=foubare('flag',a,b,c).

template.f and template.c are generic skeletons of
interface programs.

To run a Fortran demo, execute Scilab HERE in this directory and enter at 
scilab prompt:
-->exec('Examplf.sce')

To run a C demo enter at scilab prompt:
-->exec('Examplc.sce')

Other examples are *.sce script files.

make('/tmp/pgm.o') compiles pgm program in the /tmp directory.
