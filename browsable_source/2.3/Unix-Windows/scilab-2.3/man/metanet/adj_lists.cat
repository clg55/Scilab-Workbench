adj_lists(1)                   Scilab function                   adj_lists(1)
NAME
  adj_lists - computes adjacency lists

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [lp,la,ls] = adj_lists(directed,n,tail,head)

PARAMETERS

  directed : integer, 0 (undirected graph) or 1 (directed  graph)

  n : integer, the number of nodes of the graph

  tail : the row vector of the numbers of the tail nodes of the graph (its
       size is the number of edges of the graph)

  head : the row vector of the numbers of the head nodes of the graph (its
       size is the number of edges of the graph)

  lp : row vector, pointer array of the adjacency lists description of the
     graph (its size is the number of nodes of the graph + 1)

  la : row vector, arc array of the adjacency lists description of the graph
     (its size is the number of edges of the graph)

  ls : row vector, node array of the adjacency lists description of the graph
     (its size is the number of edges of the graph)

DESCRIPTION
  adj_lists computes the row vectors of the adjacency lists description of
  the graph from the description of the graph given by the number of nodes n
  and the row vectors tail and head.

EXAMPLE
  ta=[2 3 3 5 3 4 4 5 8];
  he=[1 2 4 2 6 6 7 7 4];
  g=make_graph('foo',1,8,ta,he);
  g('node_x')=[129 200 283 281 128 366 122 333];
  g('node_y')=[61 125 129 189 173 135 236 249];
  show_graph(g);
  [lp,la,ls]=adj_lists(1,g('node_number'),ta,he)
