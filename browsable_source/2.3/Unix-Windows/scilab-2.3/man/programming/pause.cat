NAME
  pause - pause mode, invoke keyboard

DESCRIPTION
  Switch to the pause mode; inserted in the code of a function, pause inter-
  rupts the execution of the function: one receives a prompt symbol which
  indicates the level of the pause (e.g. -1->). The user is then in a new
  session in which all the lower-level variables (and in particular all the
  variable of the function) are available.  To return to lower session enter
  "return"

  In this mode, [...]=return(...) returns the variables of the argument (...)
  to lower session with names in the output  [...]. Otherwise, the lower-
  level variables are protected and cannot be modified.

  The pause is extremely useful for debugging purposes.

  This mode is killed by the command "abort".
