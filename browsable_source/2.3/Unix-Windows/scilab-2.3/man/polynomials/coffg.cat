coffg(8)                       Scilab Function                       coffg(8)
NAME
  coffg - inverse of polynomial matrix

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [Ns,d]=coffg(Fs)

PARAMETERS

  Fs   : square polynomial matrix

DESCRIPTION
  coffg computes Fs^-1 where Fs is a polynomial matrix by co-factors method.

  Fs inverse = Ns/d

  d = common denominator; Ns =  numerator (a polynomial matrix)

  (For large matrices,be patient...results are generally reliable)

EXAMPLE
  s=poly(0,'s')
  a=[ s, s^2+1; s  s^2-1];
  [a1,d]=coffg(a);
  (a1/d)-inv(a)
