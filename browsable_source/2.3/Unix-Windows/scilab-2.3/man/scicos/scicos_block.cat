NAME
  scicos_block - Scicos block data structure

DEFINITION
  blk=list('Block',graphics,model,void,gui)

PARAMETERS

  "Block"   : keyword used to define list as a Scicos block representation

  graphics  : Scilab list, graphic properties data structure

  model     : Scilab list, system properties data structure.
  void      : unused, reserved for future use.

  gui       : character string, the name of the graphic user interface func-
            tion (generally written in Scilab) associated with the block.

DESCRIPTION
  Scicos editor creates and uses for each block a data structure containing
  all information relative to the graphic interface and simulation part of
  the block. Each of them are stored in the Scicos editor main data struc-
  ture. Index of these in Scicos editor main data structure is given by the
  creation order.
  For Super blocks model(8) contains a data structure similar to the
  scicos_main data structure.
