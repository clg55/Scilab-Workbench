DELAY_f(5)                      Scicos Block                       DELAY_f(5)
NAME
  DELAY_f - Scicos  delay block

DIALOGUE PARAMETERS

  Discretization time step : positive scalar, delay discretization time step

  Register initial state   : register initial state vector. Dimension must be
                           greater than  or equal to 2

DESCRIPTION
  This block implements as a discretized delay. It is in fact a Scicos super
  block formed by a shift register and a clock.

  value of the delay is given by  the discretization time step multiplied by
  the number of states of the register minus one
