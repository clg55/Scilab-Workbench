NAME
  scicos - Block diagram editor and GUI for the hybrid simulator scicosim

CALLING SEQUENCE
  sys=scicos()
  sys=scicos(sys,[menus])
  sys=scicos(file,[menus])

PARAMETERS

  sys  : a Scicos data structure

  file : a character string. The path of a file containing the  image of a
       Scicos data structure. These files may have .cos or

  menus
       : a vector of character strings. It allows to select some of the
       Scicos menus. If menus==[]  Scicos draws the diagram and the contents
       of each super blocks in separate windows without menu bar. This option
       is useful to print diagrams.
DESCRIPTION
  Scicos is a visual editor for constructing models of hybrid dynamical sys-
  tems. Invoking Scicos with no argument opens up an empty Scicos window.
  Models can then be assembled, loaded, saved, compiled, simulated, using GUI
  of Scicos. The input and ouput arguments are only useful for debugging pur-
  poses. Scicos serves as an interface to the various block diagram compilers
  and the hybrid simulator scicosim.
