Chapters location and title are given in the "Chapters" file used by
the scilab help. Scilab needs a "whatis" file in each chapter with a
keyword followed by a brief description of the keyword. 

To add a new help chapter, the user needs to:

 - create the associated directory and help files (with extension
   .cat) 
 - create the "whatis"  file 
 - include the directory  path and title in the "Chapters" file.

For instance, if you want that the command "help my_item" works,
you should write two files:

The file my_item.cat should contain the material diaplayed.
The file whatis should contain a brief description of my_item.
Assuming that these files are located in the directory
/usr/home/john, the last line of the Chapters file should
be:
/usr/home/john  A-title

The scilab *.cat files are generated from *.man files by
"formatman" shell script  and the whatis files are also
generated by "formatman" (see Makefile);

"Chapters" file path may be changed  in the scilab file :
routines/sun/inffic.c
