.SH PARAMETERS
.TP 2
g
: graph list, optional argument with default value \fVthe_g\fR
.TP 2
c
: integer, cost value of the flow on the return arc (sink,source)
.TP 2
f
: array of the flows on the arcs
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fVmincf0\fR returns the minimum linear cost flow from the source to the sink 
for the directed graph \fVg\fR with only one source and one sink.
\fVc\fR is the cost value of the flow and \fVf\fR is the array of the flows 
on the arcs.
