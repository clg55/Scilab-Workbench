rcond -  inverse condition number

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
X
: real or complex square matrix
.SH DESCRIPTION
.Vb rcond(X)
is an estimate for the reciprocal of the
condition of \fVX\fR in the 1-norm.
.LP
If \fVX\fR is well conditioned, \fVrcond(X)\fR is close to 1.
If not, \fVrcond(X)\fR is close to 0.
.LP
.Vb [r,z]=rcond(X)  
sets \fVr\fR to \fVrcond(X)\fR and returns \fVz\fR such that
.LP
.Vb norm(X*z,1) = r*norm(X,1)*norm(z,1) 
Thus, if \fVrcond\fR is small \fVz\fR is a vector in the kernel.
