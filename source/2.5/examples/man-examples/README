In this directory we show how to customize Scilab help by 
adding two new sections. Unix-Linux platforms only!

Directories helpdir1 and helpdir2 contain .man files which
are processed (transformed into .cat files) and the whatis
files are generated. 

Defining in Scilab an updated %helps variable:
%helps = [%helps; 
"./helpdir1", "Title1";
"./helpdir2", "Title2";
];
allows the items in helpdir1 and helpdir2 to be in the
Scilab help.

Edit the Makefile and set SCIDIR to your 
Scilab version path. Then run make to compile the manuals. 

You can change your Scilab startup ( .scilab ) 
by adding the content of the file help.sce 
in order to get access to the new help sections.
