%helps(1)                      Scilab Function                      %helps(1)

NAME
  %helps - Variable defining the path of help directories

DESCRIPTION
  The variable %helps is an N x 2 matrix of strings.  The kth row of %helps,
  %helps(k,:) represents the kth chapter of the manual and is made of two
  strings:

  %helps(k,1) is a pathname for a help directory.

  %helps(k,2) is a title for this help directory.  For instance, for k=2, we
  have the graphics chapter %helps(2,:).

  The variable %helps is defined in the Scilab startup file
  SCI+"/scilab.star".

  To add a new help directory, the user should add a row to the variable
  %helps. (One row for each directory).

  For instance, %helps=[%helps; "Path-Of-My-Help-Dir","My-Title"]; enables
  the Scilab help browser to look for help manual items in the directory with
  pathname "Path-Of-My-Help-Dir".

  "My-Title" is then the title of a new help chapter which appears in the
  bottom part of the help window, raised by clicking on the help button.

  A valid help directory must contain:

  1- A set of .cat files (e.g. item1.cat, item2.cat etc).  The .cat files do
  do require special format. Usually, they are built as Unix man pages.

  2- A whatis file, which must have a special format. Each row of the whatis
  must be as follows:
  item - what is item @item

  item is the item of the help, i.e. the command help item returns the con-
  tents of the file item.cat.

  what is item is a brief description of the item.

  Thewhatis file appears in the top window of the help window, once a chapter
  has been selected in the bottom window.

  Clicking on one item of the top window opens the manual page.

  The command apropos keyword returns the row(s) of all the whatis file(s) in
  which the keyword appears.
  On Unix-Linux platforms Scilab provides a Makefile for transforming
