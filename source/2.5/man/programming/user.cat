NAME
  user - interfacing a fortran routine

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [s_1,s_2,...,s_lhs]=user(e_1,e_2,...,e_rhs)

DESCRIPTION
  With this command it is possible to use an external program as a Scilab
  command where  (s_1,s_2,...,s_lhs) are the output variables and
   (e_1,e_2,...,e_rhs) are the input variables. To insert this command in
  Scilab one has to write a few lines in the user fortran subroutine of
  Scilab. See intersci or the Scilab documentation for more information.
