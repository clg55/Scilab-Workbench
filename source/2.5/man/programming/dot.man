.SH DESCRIPTION
.TP 6
. 
Dot is used to mark decimal point for numbers : 3.25 and 0.001
.TP
.<op>
used in cunjunction with other operator symbols (* / \\ ^ ') to form
other operators.  Element-by-element multiplicative operations are
obtained using .* , .^ , ./ , .\\ or .'.  For example, C = A ./ B is
the matrix with elements c(i,j) = a(i,j)/b(i,j). Kronecker product is
noted .*. .

Note that when dot follows a number it is alway prt of the number so 2.*x is evaluated as 2.0*x and 2 .*x is evaluated as (2).*x
.TP
.. 
Continuation.  Two or more decimal points at the end of
a line causes the following line to be a continuation.
