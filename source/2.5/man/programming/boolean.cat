NAME
  boolean - Scilab Objects, boolean variables and operators & | ~

DESCRIPTION
  A boolean variable is %T (for "true") or %F (for "false").  These variables
  can be used to define matrices of booleans, with the usual syntax. Boolean
  matrices can be manipulated as ordinary matrices for elements extrac-
  tion/insertion and concatenation. Note that  other usual operations  (+, *,
  -, ^, etc) are undefined for booleans matrices, three special operators are
  defined for boolean matrices:

  ~b        : is the element wise negation of boolean b (matrix).

  b1&b2     : is the element wise logical and of b1 and b2 (matrices).

  b1|b2     : is the  element wise logical or of b1 and b2 (matrices).

  Boolean variables can be used for indexing matrices or vectors.
            For instance a([%T,%F,%T],:) returns the submatrix made of rows 1
            and 3 of a.  Boolean sparse matrices are supported.

EXAMPLE
  [1,2]==[1,3]
  [1,2]==1
  a=1:5; a(a>2)
