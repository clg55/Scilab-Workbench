fscanfMat(1)                   Scilab Function                   fscanfMat(1)
NAME
  fscanfMat - Reads a Matrix from a text file.

CALLING SEQUENCE
  M=fscanfMat(filename);

PARAMETERS

  filename : a character string giving the name of the  file  to  be
            scanned.

  M         : Output variable. A matrix of real numbers.

DESCRIPTION
  The fscanfMat function is used to read a scalar matrix from a text file.
  The first non-numeric lines of the file are ignored and all the remaining
  lines must have the same number of columns (column separator are assumed to
  be white spaces or tab characters). The number of columns of the matrix
  will  follow the number of columns found in the file and the number of
  lines is fetched by detecting eof in the input file. This function can be
  used to read back numerical data saved with the fprintfMat.

EXAMPLE
  fd=mopen(TMPDIR+'/Mat','w');
  mfprintf(fd,'Some text.....0);
  mfprintf(fd,'Some text again0);
  a=rand(6,6);
  for i=1:6 ,
          for j=1:6, mfprintf(fd,'%5.2f ',a(i,j));end;
          mfprintf(fd,'0);
  end
  mclose(fd);
  a1=fscanfMat(TMPDIR+'/Mat')
