stacksize(1)                   Scilab Function                   stacksize(1)
NAME
  stacksize - set scilab stack size

CALLING SEQUENCE
  stacksize(n)
  sz=stacksize()

PARAMETERS

  n         : integer, the required stack size given in number of double pre-
            cision words

  sz        : 2-vector [total used]

DESCRIPTION
  Scilab stores all variables in a unique stack stk.

  stacksize(n) allows the user to increase or decrease the size of this
  stack. The maximum allowed size depends on the amount of free memory and
  swap space available at the time.

  This function with the n argument may only be called at the main prompt; it
  cannot be called within a scilab function.

  sz=stacksize() returns a 2-vector which contains  the current total and
  used stack size. It can be used everywhere.
