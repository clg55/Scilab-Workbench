sysconv(1)                     Scilab Function                     sysconv(1)
NAME
  sysconv - system conversion

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [s1,s2]=sysconv(s1,s2)

PARAMETERS
  s1,s2 : list (linear syslin systems)

DESCRIPTION
  Converts s1 and s2 into common representation in order that system inter-
  connexion operations can be applied. Utility function for experts. The con-
  version rules in given in the following table.

  "c"     : continuous time system

  "d"     : discrete time system

  n       : sampled system with sampling period n

  []      : system with undefined time domain

          For mixed systems s1 and s2 are put in state-space representation.
           s1\s2|    "c"     |     "d"     |      n2        |     []     |
           ---------------------------------------------------------------
           "c"   | nothing    |uncompatible | c2e(s1,n2)     |  c(s2)     |
           ---------------------------------------------------------------
           "d"   |uncompatible| nothing     | e(s1,n2)       |  d(s2)     |
           ---------------------------------------------------------------
           n1    | c2e(s2,n1) | e(s2,n1)    | n1<>n2 uncomp  |  e(s2,n1)  |
                 |            |             | n1=n2  nothing |            |
           ---------------------------------------------------------------
           []    | c(s1)      | d(s1)       | e(s1,n2)       |  nothing   |
           ---------------------------------------------------------------
          With the following meaning:

  n1,n2       : sampling period

  c2e(s,n)    : the continuous-time system s is transformed into a sampled
              system with sampling period n.

  c(s)        : conversion to continuous (time domain is "c")

  d(s)        : conversion to discrete (time domain is "d")

  e(s,n)      : conversion to samples system with period n
EXAMPLE
  s1=ssrand(1,1,2);
  s2=ss2tf(s1);
  [s1,s2]=sysconv(s1,s2);
