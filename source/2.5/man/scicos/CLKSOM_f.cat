CLKSOM_f(5)                      Scicos Block                     CLKSOM_f(5)
NAME
  CLKSOM_f - Scicos event addition block

DIALOGUE PARAMETERS
  None.

DESCRIPTION
  This block is an event addition block with up to three inputs. The output
  reproduces the events on all the input ports. Strictly speaking, CLKSOM is
  not a Scicos block because it is discarded at the compilation phase. The
  inputs and output of CLKSOM are synchronized.
