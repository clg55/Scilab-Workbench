TCLSS_f(5)                       Scicos Block                      TCLSS_f(5)
NAME
  TCLSS_f - Scicos jump continuous-time linear state-space system

DESCRIPTION
  This block realizes a continuous-time linear state-space system with the
  possibility of jumps in the state. The number of inputs to this block is
  two. The first input is the regular input of the linear system, the second
  carries the new value of the state which is copied into the state when an
  event arrives at the unique event input port of this block. That means the
  state of the system jumps to the value present on the second input (of size
  equal to that of the state).  The system is defined by the (A,B,C,D) matri-
  ces and the initial state x0. The dimensions must be compatible. The sizes
  of inputs and outputs are adjusted automatically.
