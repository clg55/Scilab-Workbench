  READC_f - Scicos "read from C binary file" block

DIALOGUE PARAMETERS

  Time record Selection
                      : an empty matrix or a positive integer. If an integer
                      i is given the  ith element of the read record is
                      assumed to be the date of the output event. If empty no
                      output event exists.

  Output record selection
                      : a vector of positive integer. [k1,..,kn],The kith
                      element of  the read record gives the value of ith out-
                      put.

  Input file name     : a character string defining the path of the file

  Input Format        : a character string defining the  format to use

                      "l","s","ul","us","d","f","c","uc"
                                   : for reading  respectively  long, ashort,
                                   unsigned long,  unsigned short, double,
                                   float,  char and  unsigned char. If
                                   required by the swap mode, the bytes which
                                   are read are automatically swapped if nec-
                                   essary (by checking little-endian status)
                                   in order to produce machine independent
                                   binary files ( in little-endian mode).

                      "ull","uls","ubl","ubs",
                                   : can be used for reading respectively
                                   unsigned little-endian long or short and
                                   unsigned big-endian long or short.

                      "dx","fx","lx","sx"
                                   : with x=b or x=l can be used for reading
                                   double, float, long or short as big or
                                   little endian.

  Record size         : The file is supposed to be formed by a sequence  of
                      data with same format. these data are organized in a
                      sequence of record each of them containing Record size
                      data.

  Buffer size         : To improve efficiency it is possible to buffer the
                      input data. read on the file is only done after each
                      Buffer size call to the block.

  Initial record index
                      : a scalar. This fixes the first record of the file to
                      use.

  Swap mode           : With Swap mode=1  the file is supposed to be coded in
                      "little endian IEEE format" and data are swaped if nec-
                      essary to match the IEEE format of the processor. If
                      Swap mode=0  then automatic bytes swap is disabled.

DESCRIPTION
  This block allows user to read datas in a C file.  Output record selection
  and Time record Selection allows the user to select data among file
  records.

  Each call to the block advance one record in the file.
