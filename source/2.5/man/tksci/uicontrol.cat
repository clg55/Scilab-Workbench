uicontrol(2)                   Scilab Function                   uicontrol(2)
NAME
  uicontrol - create a Graphic User Interface object

  Author: Bertrand Guiheneuf

  This routine is the one which enventualy creates the Graphich User Inter-
  face Controls in the figures. This is a scingle instruction, but in con-
  jonction with set(), it allows to create button, lists, ....

Usage
  h=uicontrol([ prop1, val1 ] [,  prop2, val2 ] ...)  or h=uicontrol(f, [
  prop1, val1 ] [,  prop2, val2 ] ...)

Input parameter

  o     f : integer handle of the figure which will contain the control

  o     prop{1, 2 ...} : character string name of a property to set

  o     val{1, 2 ...} : scilab object value to give to the corresponding
       property

Output parameters
  handle of the created object

Description
  this routine creates an object in a figure. If the handle of the figure is
  given (as the first parameter), the uicontrol is created in this figure.
  If no handle is given, the uicontrol is created in the current figure (
  which may be obtained with a call to gcf() ). If there is no current fig-
  ure, then one is created before the creation of the uicontrol.  Then when
  the control is created, the properties given as parameters are set with the
  coresponding values. It is equivalent to create the uicontrol, and then set
  its properties with the set() command. Nevertheless, it generally more
  efficient to set the properties in the call to uicontrol(). This is partic-
  ularly true coincerning the 'style' field. Indeed, the default value for
  this property is 'pushbutton'. So if you do not set it at creation time, a
  button will be created, and will be transformed to another uicontrol when
  you call the get(h,'style', ... ) instruction.  Scilab and all the graphic
  objects communicate through the property mechanism. Thus, to create adapted
  uicontrol, one has to know the use of the property fields. Those are
  descibed under:

Properties
BackgroundColor
  [ 1,3] real vector or string Background color of the uicontrol. A color is
  specified as Red, Green and Blue values. Those values are real in [ 0,1 ].
  The color can be given as a real vector, ie [ R,G,B ] or a string where
  each value is separated by a |, ie "R|G|B"

callback
  string String evaluated by the  scilab interpreter when an usicontrol is
  activated.  (for example when you click on a button).

fontangle
  string : {'normal'} | italic | oblique For a control containing some text,
  this property sets the slant of the font.

fontsize
  real For a control containing some text, this property sets the size  of
  the font in FontUnits.

fontunits
  string : {points} | pixels | normalized For a control containing some text,
  this property sets the units with which the fontsize is specified.

fontweight
  string : light | {normal} | demi | bold For a control containing some text,
  this property sets the weight of the used font

ListboxTop
  integer For a ListBox, this property tells which item of the list appears
  on the first line of the visible area of the list.

Max
  scalar Specifies the largest value the 'value' property can be set to.  It
  has however differnet meaning on each uicontrol:

  o     Check Boxes : Max is the value the 'value' property take when control
       is checked

  o     Silders  : Maximinum value of the slider

  o     List boxes : if (Max-Min)>1 the list allows multiple selection, Oth-
       erwise not.

Max
  scalar Specifies the lowest value the 'value' property can be set to.  It
  has however differnet meaning on each uicontrol:

  o     Check Boxes : Min is the value the 'value' property take when control
       is unchecked

  o     Silders  : Mininum value of the slider

  o     List boxes : if (Max-Min)>1 the list allows multiple selection, Oth-
       erwise not.

Parent
  integer Handle of the control parent. Changing this property allows to move
  a control from a figure to another.

Position
  [ 1,4] real vector or string This property is used to set or get the geo-
  metrical configuration of a control.  It is a real; vector : x y w h where
  the letters stand for the x location of the left bottom corner, the y loca-
  tion of the left bottom corner, the width and the height of the uicontrol.
  The unit is determined by the 'Unit' property.  One can also set this prop-
  erty by giving a string where the fields are separated by a '|', ie
  "x|y|w|h".

SliderStep
  [ 1,2] real vector or string small big This property represents the step a
  slider is moved when the user click on the arrow (small step) or on the
  slide bar (big step).

String
  string Generally, this property represents the text appearing in a uicon-
  trol.  Its exact meaning sometimes depends on the uicontrol style:

  o     List Boxes, Popup Menu the value can be a vector of string or a
       string where the items are separated by a '|'.

Style
  string : {pushbutton} | radiobutton | checkbox | edit | text | slider |
  frame |listbox | popupmenu Style of the uicontrol. Here is a short descrip-
  tion of each one:

  o     pushbutton A rectangular button generally used to run a callback.

  o     radiobutton A button whith to states : on or off.

  o     checkbox a small uicontrol that have to state : on or off

  o     edit an editable string control

  o     text a text control (generally static).

  o     slider a scale control, that is a scrollbar use to set values between
       in  range with the mouse.

  o     frame a control representing a zone used to group of related con-
       trols.

  o     listbox a control representing a list of item that can be scrolled.
       The item can be selected with the mouse.

  o     popupmenu a button which make a menu appear when clicked.

Tag
  string this property is generally used to identify the control. It allows
  to give it a "name". Mainly used in conjontion with findobj().

Units
  string :  {points} | pixels | normalized Set the units used to specify the
  'position' property.

Userdata
  scilab object this can be used to associate any scilab object to an uicon-
  trol.

Value
  Value of the uicontrol. The eact meaning depends on the style of the uivon-
  trol.

  o     Check boxes, Radio buttons value is set to Max (see above) when on
       and Min when off.

  o     List Boxes, Popu Menu value is a vector of indexes corresponding to
       the index of the selected entry in the list. 1 is the first item of
       the list.

  o     Sliders value indicated by the slider bar.

EXAMPLE
  f=figure();
  // create a figure
  h=uicontrol(f,'style','listbox', ...
   'position', [10 10 150 160]);
  // create a listbox
  set(h, 'string', "item 1|item 2|item3");
  // fill the list
  set(h, 'value', [1 3]);
  // select item 1 and 3 in the list
  close();
  // close the figure
  f=figure();
  // create a figure
  h=uicontrol(f,'style','listbox', ...
   'position', [10 10 150 160]);
  // create a listbox
  set(h, 'string', "item 1|item 2|item3");
  // fill the list
  set(h, 'value', [1 3]);
  // select (highlight) the item 1 and 3 in the list
  close();
  //close the figure
