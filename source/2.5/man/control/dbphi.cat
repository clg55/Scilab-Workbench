dbphi(1)                       Scilab Function                       dbphi(1)
NAME
  dbphi - frequency response to phase and magnitude representation

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [db,phi] =dbphi(repf)

PARAMETERS

  db,phi
       : vector of gains (db) and phases (degrees)

  repf : vector of complex frequency response

DESCRIPTION

  db(k) is the magnitude of repf(k) expressed in dB i.e.
  db(k)=20*log(abs(repf(k)))/log(10) and phi(k) is the phase of repf(k)
  expressed in degrees.
