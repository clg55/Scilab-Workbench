NAME
  calfrq - frequency response discretization

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [frq,split]=calfrq(h,[fmin,fmax])

PARAMETERS

  h         : SISO linear system (syslin list)

  fmin,fmax : real scalars (min and max frequencies)

  frq       : row vector (discretization of interval)

  split     : vector of frq splitting points indexes

DESCRIPTION
  frequency response discretization ; frq is the discretization of
  [fmin,fmax] such that the peaks in the frequency response are well repre-
  sented.

  Default values for fmin and fmax are 1.d-3, 1.d+3 if h is continuous-time
  or 1.d-3, 1/(2*h('dt')) if h is discrete-time.

  Singularities are located between frq(split(k)) and frq(split(k)+1) for
  k>1.
EXAMPLE
  s=poly(0,'s')
  h=syslin('c',(s^2+2*0.9*10*s+100)/(s^2+2*0.3*10.1*s+102.01))
  h1=h*syslin('c',(s^2+2*0.1*15.1*s+228.01)/(s^2+2*0.9*15*s+225))
  [f1,spl]=calfrq(h1,0.01,1000);
  rf=repfreq(h1,f1);
  plot2d(real(rf)',imag(rf)')
