householder(G)                 Scilab Function                 householder(G)
NAME
  householder - Householder orthogonal reflexion matrix

CALLING SEQUENCE
  u=householder(v [,w])

PARAMETERS

  v    : real or complex column vector

  w    : real or complex column vector with same size as v. Default value is
       eye(v)

  u    : real or complex column vector

DESCRIPTION
  given 2 column vectors v,  w of same size, householder(v,w) returns a uni-
  tary column vector u, such that  (eye()-2*u*u')*v is proportional to w.
  (eye()-2*u*u') is the orthogonal Householder reflexion matrix .

  w default value is  eye(v). In this case vector  (eye()-2*u*u')*v is the
  vector   eye(v)*norm(v).
