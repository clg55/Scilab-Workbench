pinv(G)                        Scilab Function                        pinv(G)
NAME
  pinv - pseudoinverse

CALLING SEQUENCE
  pinv(A,[tol])

PARAMETERS

  A    : real or complex matrix

  tol  : real number

DESCRIPTION
  X = pinv(A) produces a matrix X of the same  dimensions as A' such that:

  A*X*A = A, X*A*X = X  and both A*X and X*A are Hermitian .

  The computation is  based  on SVD and  any  singular values lower than a
  tolerance are treated   as zero: this  tolerance is accessed by
  X=pinv(A,tol).

EXAMPLE
  A=rand(5,2)*rand(2,4);
  norm(A*pinv(A)*A-A,1)
