xsegs(2)                       Scilab Function                       xsegs(2)
NAME
  xsegs - draw unconnected segments

CALLING SEQUENCE
  xsegs(xv,yv,[style])

PARAMETERS

  xv,yv  : matrices of the same size.

  style  : vector or scalar. If style is a positive scalar, it gives the dash
         style to use for all segments. If style is a negative scalar, then
         current dash style is used. If style is a vector, then style(i)
         gives the style to use for segment i.

DESCRIPTION
  xsegs draws a set of unconnected segments given by xv and yv. If xv and yv
  are matrices they are considered as vectors by concatenating their columns.
  The coordinates of the two points defining a segment are given by two con-
  secutive values of xv and yv:

  (xv(i),yv(i))-->(xv(i+1),yv(i+1)).

  For instance, using matrices of size (2,n), the segments can be defined by:
  xv=[xi_1 xi_2 ...;
      xf_1 xf_2 ...]

  yv=[yi_1 yi_2 ...;
      yf_1 yf_2 ...]
  and the segments are (xi_k,yi_k)-->(xf_k,yf_k).

EXAMPLE
  x=2*%pi*(0:9)/8;
  xv=[sin(x);9*sin(x)];
  yv=[cos(x);9*cos(x)];
  plot2d([-10,10],[-10,10],[-1,-1],"022")
  xsegs(xv,yv,1:10)
