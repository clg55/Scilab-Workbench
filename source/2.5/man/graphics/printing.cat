DESCRIPTION
  The scilab graphics can be saved with the xbasimp command into unix files.
  The Scilab command :
          xbasimp(xx,'des.ps',0)
  will save the graphics recorded in the graphic window xx in the file
  des.ps.xx. This file can't be directly send to a Postscript printer and a
  set of programs ( in the bin Scilab directory ) are given with Scilab to
  print it :

  BEpsf     : The BEpsf command will create an Epsf file from your des.ps.xx
            under the name des.epsf, this Epsf file can be printed on a
            Postscript printer or inserted into an other Postscript document.

  Blatexpr  : The  Blatexpr command will create an Epsf file from your
            des.ps.xx
              mv des.ps.xx des.ps
              Blatexpr 1.0 1.0 des.ps
             under the name des.epsf and a LaTeX file des.tex. The file
            des.tex can be inserted in a LaTeX file in order to get the latex
            figure as follows ( the postscript file is inserted with the spe-
            cial command of LaTeX )
                    input des.tex
                    essin{caption}{label}

  Blpr      : The Blpr command is used to print a set of graphics on a same
            sheet of paper. For example to print two graphics on a unique
            page, one can use :
            Blpr "Two graphics" file1.ps.0 file2.ps.1 | lpr

  Blatexprs : The Blatexprs command is used to insert in a single LaTeX fig-
            ure a set of Scilab Graphics
            Blatexprs res file1.ps.0 file2.ps.1
            will create two files res.ps and res.tex. The file res.tex is
            used as in the Blatexpr command in order to get the figure.
