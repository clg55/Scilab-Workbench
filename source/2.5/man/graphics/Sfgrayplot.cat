NAME
  Sfgrayplot - smooth 2D plot of a surface defined by a function using colors

CALLING SEQUENCE
  Sfgrayplot(x,y,f,[strf,rect,nax])

DESCRIPTION
  Sfgrayplot is the same as fgrayplot but the plot is smoothed.  The function
  fec is used for smoothing.  The surface is plotted assuming that it is lin-
  ear on a set of triangles built from the grid:

  t=-1:0.1:1;
  deff("[z]=surf(x,y)","z=x**2+y**2")
  Sfgrayplot(t,t,surf,"111",[-2,-2,2,2])
