NAME
  plot3d - 3D plot of a surface

CALLING SEQUENCE
  plot3d(x,y,z,[theta,alpha,leg,flag,ebox])
  plot3d(xf,yf,zf,[theta,alpha,leg,flag,ebox])
  plot3d(xf,yf,list(zf,colors),[theta,alpha,leg,flag,ebox])

PARAMETERS

  x,y          : row vectors of sizes n1 and n2 (x-axis and y-axis coordi-
               nates). These coordinates must be monotone.

  z            : matrix of size (n1,n2). z(i,j) is the value of the surface
               at the point (x(i),y(j)).

  xf,yf,zf     : matrices of size (nf,n).  They define the facets used to
               draw the surface. There are n facets.  Each facet i is defined
               by a polygon with nf points.  The x-axis, y-axis and z-axis
               coordinates of the points of the ith facet are given respec-
               tively by xf(:,i), yf(:,i) and zf(:,i).

               You can give a specific color for each facet by using
               list(zf,colors) instead of zf, where colors is a vector of
               size n. colors(i) is the color of facet i. If colors(i) is
               negative, color id -colors(i) is used and the boundary of the
               facet is drawn.  Use xset() to see the ids of the colors.

  theta, alpha : real values giving in degree the spherical coordinates of
               the observation point.

  leg          : string defining the captions for each axis with @ as a field
               separator, for example "X@Y@Z".

  flag         : a real vector of size three flag=[mode,type,box].

               mode : string (treatment of hidden parts).

                    mode>0
                      the hidden parts of the surface are removed and the
                      surface is painted with color mode.

                    mode=0
                      the hidden parts of the surface are drawn.

                    mode<0
                      only the shadow of the surface is painted with color or
                      pattern id -mode. Use xset() to see the meaning of the
                      ids.

               type : an integer (scaling).

                    type=0  the plot is made using the current 3D scaling
                            (set by a previous call to param3d, plot3d, con-
                            tour or plot3d1).

                    type=1  the boundaries are specified by the value of the
                            optional argument ebox.

                    other values
                            the boundaries are computed using the given data.

               box  : an integer (frame around the plot).

                    box=0
                      nothing is drawn around the plot.

                    box=1
                      unimplemented (like box=0).

                    box=2
                      only the axes behind the surface are drawn.

                    box=3
                      a box surrounding the surface is drawn and captions are
                      added.

                    box=4
                      a box surrounding the surface is drawn, captions and
                      axes are added.

  ebox         : used when type in flag is 1. It specifies the boundaries of
               the plot as the vector [xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax,zmin,zmax].

DESCRIPTION
  plot3d(x,y,z,[theta,alpha,leg,flag,ebox]) draws the surface z=f(x,y).

  plot3d(xf,yf,zf,[theta,alpha,leg ,flag,ebox]) draws a surface defined by a
  set of facets. You can draw multiple plots by replacing xf, yf and zf by
  multiple matrices assembled by rows as [xf1 xf2 ...], [yf1 yf2 ...] and
  [zf1 zf2 ...].

  You can use the function genfac3d to compute four sided facets from the
  surface z=f(x,y). eval3dp can also be used.

  Enter the command  plot3d() to see a demo.

EXAMPLE
  // simple plot using z=f(x,y)
  t=[0:0.3:2*%pi]'; z=sin(t)*cos(t');
  plot3d(t,t,z)
  // same plot using facets computed by genfac3d
  [xx,yy,zz]=genfac3d(t,t,z);
  xbasc()
  plot3d(xx,yy,zz)
  // multiple plots
  xbasc()
  plot3d([xx xx],[yy yy],[zz 4+zz])
  // multiple plots using colors
  xbasc()
  plot3d([xx xx],[yy yy],list([zz zz+4],[4*ones(1,400) 5*ones(1,400)]))
  // simple plot with viewpoint and captions
  xbasc()
  plot3d(1:10,1:20,10*rand(10,20),35,45,"X@Y@Z",[2,2,3])
  // plot of a sphere using facets computed by eval3dp
  deff("[x,y,z]=sph(alp,tet)",["x=r*cos(alp).*cos(tet)+orig(1)*ones(tet)";..
    "y=r*cos(alp).*sin(tet)+orig(2)*ones(tet)";..
    "z=r*sin(alp)+orig(3)*ones(tet)"]);
  r=1; orig=[0 0 0];
  [xx,yy,zz]=eval3dp(sph,linspace(-%pi/2,%pi/2,40),linspace(0,%pi*2,20));
  xbasc()
  plot3d(xx,yy,zz)
