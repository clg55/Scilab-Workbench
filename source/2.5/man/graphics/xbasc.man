Otherwise it clears the graphics windows whose numbers are included 
in the vector \fVwindow-id\fR,
and erases the corresponding recorded graphics. For example 
\fVxbasc(1:3)\fR clears windows 1, 2 and 3 and erases the corresponding 
recorded graphics. If one of the windows does not 
exist, then it is automatically created.
