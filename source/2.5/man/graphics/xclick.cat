DESCRIPTION
  xclick waits for a mouse click in the graphics window.

  If it is called with 3 left hand side arguments, it waits for a mouse click
  in the current graphics window.

  If it is called with 4 or 5 left hand side arguments, it waits for a mouse
  click in any graphics window.

  The returned values are described below.

  c_i      : an integer which gives the number of the mouse button that was
           pressed 0, 1 or 2 (for left, middle and right) or -1 in case of
           problems with xclick.

  c_x,c_y  : the coordinates of the position of the mouse click in the cur-
           rent graphics scale.

  c_w      : the window number where the click has occurred.

  c_m      : string associated with a dynamic menu. If xclick returns due to
           a click on a menu, c_i, c_x, c_y, and c_w take arbitrary values.

KNOWN TROUBLES
  xclick can return the message "Can't grab the pointer" if the graphics win-
  dow is iconified when calling it.
