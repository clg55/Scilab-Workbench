NAME
  int3d - definite 3D integral by quadrature and cubature method

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [result,err]=int3d(X,Y,Z,f [,nf[,params]])

PARAMETERS

  X         : a 4 by NUMTET array containing the abscissae of the vertices
              of the NUMTET tetrahedrons.

  Y         : a 4 by NUMTET array containing the ordinates of the vertices
              of the NUMTET tetrahedrons.

  Z         : a 4 by NUMTET array containing the third coordinates of the
            vertices
              of the NUMTET tetrahedrons.

  f         : external (function or list or string) defining the integrand
            f(xyz,nf), where xyz is the vector of a point coordinates and nf
            the number functions

  nf        : the number of function to integate (default is 1)

  params    : real vector [minpts, maxpts, epsabs, epsrel]. default value is
            [0, 1000, 0.0, 1.d-5].

            epsabs
              : Desired bound on the absolute error.

            epsrel
              : Desired bound on the relative error.

            minpts
              : Minimum number of function evaluations.

            maxpts
              : Maximum number of function evaluations.  The number of func-
              tion evaluations over each subregion is 43

  result    : the integral value,or vector of the integral values.

  err       : Estimates of absolute errors.
DESCRIPTION

  The function calculates an approximation to a given vector of definite
  integrals
  I  I  I (F ,F ,...,F )      dx(3)dx(2)dx(1),
            1  2      numfun
  where the region of integration is a collection of NUMTET tetrahedrons and
  where
  F = F (X(1),X(2),X(3)), J = 1,2,...,NUMFUN.
   J   J

  A globally adaptive strategy is applied in order to compute approximations
  result(k) hopefully satisfying, for each component of I, the following
  claim for accuracy: ABS(I(K)-RESULT(K))<=MAX(EPSABS,EPSREL*ABS(I(K)))
  int3d repeatedly subdivides the tetrahedrons with greatest estimated errors
  and estimates the integrals and the errors over the new subtetrahedrons
  until the error request is met or MAXPTS function evaluations have been
  used.

  A 43 point integration rule with all evaluation points inside the tetrahe-
  dron is applied. The rule has polynomial degree 8.

  If the values of the input parameters EPSABS or EPSREL are selected great
  enough, an integration rule is applied over each tetrahedron and the
  results are added up to give the approximations RESULT(K). No further sub-
  division of the tetrahedrons will then be applied.

  When int3d computes estimates to a vector of integrals, all components of
  the vector are given the same treatment. That is, I(Fj) and I(Fk) for

  j not equal to k, are estimated with the same subdivision of the region of
  integration.  For integrals with enough similarity, we may save time by
  applying int3d to all integrands in one call.  For integrals that varies
  continuously as functions of some parameter, the estimates produced by
  int3d  will also vary continuously when the same subdivision is applied to
  all components. This will generally not be the case when the different com-
  ponents are given separate treatment.

  On the other hand this feature should be used with caution when the differ-
  ent components of the integrals require clearly different subdivisions.
EXAMPLES
  X=[0;1;0;0];
  Y=[0;0;1;0];
  Z=[0;0;0;1];
  deff('v=f(xyz,numfun)','v=exp(xyz''*xyz)')
  [RESULT,ERROR]=int3d(X,Y,Z,'int3dex')
  // computes the integrand exp(x*x+y*y+z*z) over the
  //tetrahedron (0.,0.,0.),(1.,0.,0.),(0.,1.,0.),(0.,0.,1.)
