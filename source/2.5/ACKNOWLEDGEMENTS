         link.c ,link*.c: dynamic linking of programs for differents 
         architectures (Erlich,Chancelier,INRIA) link_linux.c was initiated 
         by B.Lapeyre CERMICS.
         zzledt.c is from Mitchell and Gauthier ass.

system: basic routines of Scilab interpreter (INRIA). Inspired by
        "classic" Matlab of C. Moler.
