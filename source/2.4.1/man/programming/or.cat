or(1)                          Scilab Function                          or(1)
NAME
  or | - logical or

CALLING SEQUENCE
  or(A),  or(A,'*')
  or(A,'r'), or(A,1)

  or(A,'c'), or(A,2)
  A|B

DESCRIPTION
  or(A)  gives the  or of the elements of the  boolean matrix  A. or(A) is
  true (%t) iff at least one entry of A is %t.

  y=or(A,'r') (or, equivalently, y=or(A,1)) is the rowwise or. It returns in
  each entry of the row vector y the or of the rows of x (The or is performed
  on the row index : y(j)= or(A(i,j),i=1,m)).

  y=or(A,'c') (or, equivalently, y=or(A,2)) is the columnwise or. It returns
  in each entry of the column vector y the or of the columns of x (The or is
  performed on the column index:  y(i)= or(A(i,j),j=1,n))).

  A|B  gives the element-wise logical or of the booleans matrices
   A and  B .A and  B must be matrices with the same
   dimensions or one from them must be a single boolean.
EXAMPLES
  or([%t %t %f])
  [%t %t %f]|[%f %t %t]
  [%t %t %f]|%f
