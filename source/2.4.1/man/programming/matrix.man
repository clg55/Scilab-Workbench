.SH DESCRIPTION
For a vector or a matrix with \fVn\fR x \fVm\fR entries
\fVy=matrix(v,n,m)\fR or similarily \fVy=matrix(v,[n,m])\fR.
transforms the \fVv\fR vector (or matrix) into an \fVnxm\fR matrix by
stacking columnwise the entries of \fVv\fR.

.LP

For an hypermatrix such as
\fVprod(size(v))==prod(sizes)\fR,\fVy=matrix(v,sizes)\fR (or
equivalently \fVy=matrix(v,n1,n2,...nm)\fR) transforms
\fVv\fR  into an  matrix or hypermatrix by 
stacking columnwise the entries of \fVv\fR. \fVy=matrix(v,sizes)\fR
results in a regular matrix if sizes is a scalar or a 2-vector.
