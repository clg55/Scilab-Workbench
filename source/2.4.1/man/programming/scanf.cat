NAME
  scanf  - Converts formatted input on standard input

CALLING SEQUENCE
   [v_1,...v_n]=scanf (format);

PARAMETERS

  format :Specifies the format conversion.

DESCRIPTION
  The scanf functions get character data on standard input (%io(1)), inter-
  pret it according to a format, and returns the converted results.

  The format parameter contains conversion specifications used to interpret
  the input.

  The format parameter can contain white-space characters (blanks, tabs, new-
  line, or formfeed) that, except in the following two cases, read the input
  up to the next nonwhite-space character. Unless there is a match in the
  control string, trailing white space (including a newline character) is not
  read.

  -   Any character except % (percent sign), which must match the next char-
      acter of the input stream.

  -   A conversion specification that directs the conversion of the next
      input field. see scanf_conversion for details.
