bessely(3)                     Scilab Function                     bessely(3)
NAME
  bessely -  Modified Y sub ALPHA Bessel functions of the second kind.

CALLING SEQUENCE
   y = bessely(alpha,x)

PARAMETERS

  x    : real vector with non negative entries

  alpha
       : real vector with non negative entries regularly spaced with incre-
       ment equal to one alpha=alpha0+(n1:n2)
DESCRIPTION
  bessely(alpha,x) computes K sub ALPHA modified Bessel functions of the
  second kind, for real, non-negative order alpha and argument x.  alpha  and
  x may be vectors.  The output is m-by-n with m = size(x,'*'), n =
  size(alpha,'*') whose (i,j) entry is bessely(alpha(j),x(i)).
EXAMPLE
  bessely(0.5:3,1:4)
