.SH DESCRIPTION
\fVcheck_graph\fR checks its argument \fVg\fR to see if it is a
graph list. The checking is not only syntactic (number of elements of the
list, compatible sizes of the vectors), but also semantic in the sense that 
\fVcheck_graph\fR checks that \fVnode_number\fR, \fVtail\fR and
\fVhead\fR elements of the list can really represent a graph.

Moreover, the names of the node must be different. In fact, this
do not give errors in Scilab, but strange behaviour can appear when using the 
Metanet window. So, this is not checked by \fVcheck_graph\fR 
because it is time consuming. It is only checked when loading, saving
or showing a graph.
