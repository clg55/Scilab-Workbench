graph_2_mat(1)                 Scilab function                 graph_2_mat(1)
NAME
  graph_2_mat - node-arc or node-node incidence matrix of a graph

CALLING SEQUENCE
  a = graph_2_mat(g,mat)

PARAMETERS

  g : graph list

  mat : optional string, 'node-arc' or 'node-node' matrix

  a : sparse node-arc or node-node incidence matrix

DESCRIPTION
  graph_2_mat computes the node-arc or the node-node incidence matrix
  corresponding to the graph g.

  If the optional argument mat is omitted or is the string

  If n is the number of nodes of the graph and m is the number of edges of
  the graph, the node-arc matrix is a Scilab sparse matrix of size (n,m).

  It is defined as follows. If the graph is directed:

  a(i,j) = +1 if node i is the tail of arc j

  a(i,j) = -1 if node i is the head of arc j

  If the graph is undirected:

  a(i,j) = 1 if node i is the tail or the head of arc j

  If n is the number of nodes of the graph, the node-node matrix is a Scilab
  sparse matrix of size (n,n).

  It is defined as follows:

  a(i,j) = 1 if there is an arc from node i to node j

EXAMPLE
  g=load_graph(SCI+'/demos/metanet/colored');
  a=graph_2_mat(g)
  a=graph_2_mat(g,'node-node')
