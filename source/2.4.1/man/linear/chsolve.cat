chsolve(G)                     Scilab Function                     chsolve(G)
NAME
  chsolve - sparse Cholesky solver

CALLING SEQUENCE
  sol=chsolve(spcho,rhs)

PARAMETERS

  spcho
       : list containing the Cholesky factors in coded form returned by
       chfact

  rhs, sol
       : full column vectors

DESCRIPTION
  sol=chsolve(spcho,rhs) computes the solution of sol=A*rhs, with A a sym-
  metric sparse positive definite matrix. This function is based on the Ng-
  Peyton programs (ORNL). See the Fortran programs for a complete description
  of the variables in spcho.

EXAMPLE
  A=sprand(20,20,0.1);
  A=A*A'+eye();
  spcho=chfact(A);
  sol=(1:20)';rhs=A*sol;
  spcho=chfact(A);
  chsolve(spcho,rhs)
