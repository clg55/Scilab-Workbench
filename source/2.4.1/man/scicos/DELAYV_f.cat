NAME
  DELAYV_f - Scicos time varying delay block

DIALOGUE PARAMETERS

  Number inputs            : size of the delayed vector (-1 not allowed)

  Register initial state   : register initial state vector. Dimension must be
                           greater than  or equal to 2

  Max delay                : Maximum delay that can be produced by this block

DESCRIPTION
  This block implements a time varying discretized delay. The value of the
  delay is given by the second input port. The delayed signal enters the
  first input port and leaves the unique output prot.

  The first event output port must be connected to unique input event port if
  auto clocking is desired. But the input event port can also be driven by
  outside clock. In that case, the max delay is size of initial condition
  times the period of the incoming clock.

  The second output event port generates an event if the second input goes
  above the maximum delay specified. This signal can be ignored. In that case
  the output will be delayed by max delay.
