This directory contains a set of macros for implementing
operations with lists.
The name of a macro is in one-to-one correspondance with
the operation.
For instance %rar stands for 'rational'-'add'-'rational':
r=r1+r2 with r1 and r2 two rationals returns a rational r.
The calculation of r is made by the macro %rar.
(A rational is a list of the following type:
r=tlist('r',n,d) where n and d are two poynomials (possibly
polynomial matrices)).

Code of macro name is as follows:
% means specific macro.
a: add      (+ operation)
s: subtract (-     "    ) 
c: catenates (for rows)
f: catenates (for columns)
t: transpose (')
l: left division ( \ )
r: right division ( / )
e: extract  (  a(i,j) )
i: insert  a(i,j)=b
m: multiply  (*)
v: feedback (/. operation)
q: elementwise left division

prefixes, postfixes

r:    tlist('r',num,den) ---> transfer num/den or syslin list.
lss:  tlist('lss,A,B,C,D,...) ---> state-space (syslin list)
s:    scalar
p:    polynomial

EXAMPLE: S=%lssmlss(S1,S2) <=> S=S1*S2  with S1,S2 = syslin lists
