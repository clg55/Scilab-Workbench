setbpt(1)                      Scilab Function                      setbpt(1)
NAME
  setbpt - setting breakpoints

CALLING SEQUENCE
  setbpt(macro-name [,line-num])

PARAMETERS

  macro-name
            : string

  line-num  : integer

DESCRIPTION
  setbpt interactively inserts a breakpoint in the line number line-num
  (default value is 1) of the function  macro-name

  When reaching the breakpoint, Scilab evaluates the specified line , prints
  the number of the line and the name of the function. If the function is not
  compiled ( see comp ) the line is printed on the screen.  Then Scilab goes
  into a pause mode in which the user can check current values. The pause is
  exited with resume or abort.  Redefining the function does not clear the
  breakpoints, the user must explicitly delete breakpoints using delbpt. The
  maximum number of functions with breakpoints enabled must be less than 20
  and the maximum number of breakpoints is set to 100.
