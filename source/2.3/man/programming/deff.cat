deff(1)                        Scilab Function                        deff(1)
NAME
  deff - on-line definition of function

CALLING SEQUENCE
  deff('[s1,s2,...]=newfunction(e1,e2,....)',text [,opt])

PARAMETERS

  e1,e2,...,     : input variables.

  s1,s2,...,     : output variables.

  text           : matrix of character strings

  opt            : optional character string

                 : function is "compiled" to be more efficient (default)

                 : function is not "compiled"

DESCRIPTION
  On-line definition of function (user defined function): the name of the
  created function is newfunction.  text is a sequence of instructions usu-
  ally set as a vector of character strings.

  This command can be used inside a function and the new function can be an
  input or output of any other function.

  Usually, functions are defined in a file and loaded into Scilab by getf

  Some time, in particular when you want to use define strings within deff
  text is rather difficult to write. A more tractable way may be to define
  your function in a file as usual, to load it into Scilab by getf (without
  'c'  option) and use sci2exp to get corresponding deff instructions.

EXAMPLES
  deff('[x]=myplus(y,z)','x=y+z')
  //
  deff('[x]=mymacro(y,z)',['a=3*y+1'; 'x=a*z+y'])
