NAME
  solve - symbolic linear system solver

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [x]=solve(A,b)

PARAMETERS

  A,b,c
       : matrix (resp. vectors) of character strings

DESCRIPTION
  solves A*x = b when A is an upper triangular matrix made of character
  strings.

EXAMPLE
  A=['1','a';'0','2'];   //Upper triangular
  b=['x';'y'];
  w=solve(A,b)
  a=1;x=2;y=5;
  evstr(w)
  inv([1,1;0,2])*[2;5]
