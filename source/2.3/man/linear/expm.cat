expm(G)                        Scilab Function                        expm(G)
NAME
  expm - square matrix exponential

CALLING SEQUENCE
  expm(X)

PARAMETERS

  X    : square matrix with real or complex entries.

DESCRIPTION

   X is a square matrix expm(X) is the matrix
  expm(X) = I + X + X^2 /2 + ...

  The computation is performed by first block-diagonalizing X and then apply-
  ing a Pade approximation on each block.

EXAMPLE
  X=[1 2;3 4]
  expm(X)
  logm(expm(X))
