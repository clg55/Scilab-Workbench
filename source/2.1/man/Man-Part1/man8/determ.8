.SH NAME
determ - determinant of polynomial matrix
.SH CALLING SEQUENCE
.nf
res=determ(W [,k])
.fi
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
W
: real square polynomial matrix
.TP
k
: integer (upper bound for the degree of the determinant of W)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.Vb res=determ(W [,k]) 
returns the determinant of a real polynomial matrix 
(computation made by FFT).
.LP
\fVk\fR is an integer larger than the actual degree of the determinant
of \fVW\fR.
.LP
The default value of \fVk\fR is the smallest power of 2 which is larger
than \fVn*maxi(degree(W))\fR.
.LP
Method: evaluate the determinant of \fVW\fR for the Fourier frequencies
and apply inverse FFT to the coefficients of the determinant.
