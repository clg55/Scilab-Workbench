.SH NAME
fort - fortran or C user routines call
.SH CALLING SEQUENCE
.nf 
[y1,...,yk]=fort("ident",x1,px1,"tx1",...,xn,pxn,"txn",
                 "out",[ny1,my1],py1,"ty1",...,[nyl,myl],pyl,"tyl")

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP 10
"ident"
: string
.TP
xi
: real matrix
.TP
pxi, pyi
: integers
.TP
txi, tyi
: character string \fV"d"\fR, \fV"r"\fR or \fV"i"\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Interactive call of Fortran (or C) user routine from Scilab. The
routine must be previously linked with scilab. This link may be done:
.RS
.TP
-
with scilab "\fVlink\fR" command (incremental "soft" linking) during the
scilab session.(see \fVlink\fR)
.TP
-
by "hard" re-linking. Writing the routine call within Scilab routine
"default/interf.f" and then re_linking all scilab with the command \fVmake bin/scilex\fR 
in main scilab directory.
.RE
.LP
The meaning of each parameter is described now:
.RS
.TP 15
"ident"
is the name of the subroutine called.
.TP 
x1,...,xn
are input variables sent to the routine,
.TP
px1,...,pxn
are the respective positions of these variables in the calling sequence of the routine and
.TP
tx1,...,txn
are their fortran types (\fV"r","i", "d",\fR  for real, integer, double precision)
(strings are treated as integers).
.TP 
"out"
is a keyword used to separate input variables from output variables.
.TP
[ny1, my1]
are the size (# of rows and columns) of output variables and
.TP
py1, ...
are the positions of output variables (possibly equal to \fVpxi\fR ).
.TP
"ty1", ...
are the fortran types of output variables.
The  k  first output variables are put in \fVy1,..., yk\fR.
.RE
.LP
If an output variable coincides with an input variable
(i.e. \fVpyi=pxj\fR ) one can pass only its position \fVpyi\fR .
The size and type of \fVyi\fR are the same as those of \fVxi\fR .
.LP
In the case of short syntax , \fV[y1,....,yk]=fort("ident",x1,...,xn)\fR,
the \fVtxi, nyj, myj \fR and \fVtyj\fR are then given in the routine \fVinterf\fR  (see the source code in 
the directory \fVSCIDIR/default\fR).
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
      subroutine foo(a,b,c)
      c=2*a+b
      end

      link("foo.o","foo")
      a=13;b=10;
      c=fort("foo",a,1,"r",b,2,"r","out",[1,1],3,"r")
.fi
returns the scalar (1x1 matrix) \fVc=2*a+b\fR with \fVa=13\fR and \fV b=10\fR.
\fVa\fR (resp.\fV b,c\fR ) is the first (resp. 2nd, 3rd) argument passed to \fVfoo\fR .
If your machine is a DEC Alpha, SUN Solaris or SGI you may have to change the 
previous command line \fVlink("foo.o","foo") \fR by one of the followings :
.nf
link('foo.o -lfor -lm -lc','foo').
link('foo.o -lftn -lm -lc','foo').
link('foo.o -L/opt/SUNWspro/SC3.0/lib/lib77 -lm -lc','foo').
.fi
