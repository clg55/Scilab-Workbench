[XLISTF[,OPT]] = lmisolver(XLIST0,EVALFUNC[,options])
\end{verbatim}
where
\begin{itemize}

\item {\tt XLIST0:} a list structure including matrices and/or list of matrices.
It contains initial guess on the values of the unknown matrices. In general, the
ith element of {\tt XLIST0} is the initial guess on the value of the
unknown matrix $X_i$. In some cases
however it is more convenient to define one or more elements of
{\tt XLIST0} to be lists (of unknown matrices) themselves. This is a
useful feature when the number of unknown matrices is not fixed a priori
(see Example of Section~\ref{ex2}).

The values of the matrices in {\tt XLIST0}, if compatible with the LME 
functions, 
are used as intial condition for the optimization algorithm; they are
ignored otherwise. The size and structure of {\tt XLIST0} are used to
set up the problem and determine the size and structure of the output {\tt 
XLISTF}.

\item
{\tt EVALFUNC:} a Scilab function called {\em evaluation function}
(supplied by the user)
which evaluates the LME, LMI and objective functions, given the values of the
unknown matrices. The syntax is:
\begin{verbatim}
[LME,LMI,OBJ]=EVALFUNC(XLIST)
\end{verbatim}
where
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt XLIST:} a list, identical in size and structure to {\tt XLIST0}.

\item {\tt LME:} a list of matrices containing values of the LME
functions $G_i$'s
for $X$ values in {\tt XLIST}. {\tt LME} can be a matrix in case
there is only one LME function to be evaluated (instead of a list
containing this matrix as unique element). It can also be a list
of a mixture of matrices and lists which in turn contain values of
LME's, and so on.

\item {\tt LMI:} a list of matrices containing the values of the LMI
functions $H_j$'s
for $X$ values in {\tt XLIST}. {\tt LMI} can also be a matrix (in case
there is only one LMI function to be evaluated). It can also be a list
of a mixture of matrices and lists which in turn contain values of
of LMI's, and so on.

\item {\tt OBJ:} a scalar equal to the value of the objective function $f$
for $X$ values in {\tt XLIST}.
\end{itemize}
If the $\Sigma$ problem has no equality constraints then {\tt LME}
should be {\tt []}. Similarly for {\tt LMI} and {\tt OBJ}.

\item
{\tt options:} a $5 \times 1$ vector containing optimization
parameters {\tt Mbound}, {\tt abstol}, {\tt nu}, {\tt maxiters},
and {\tt reltol}, see  manual page for {\tt semidef} for details ({\tt Mbound}
is a multiplicative coefficient for {\tt M}). This argument is optional,
if omitted, default parameters are used.


\item {\tt XLISTF:} a list, identical in size and structure to {\tt XLIST0}
containing the solution of the problem (optimal values of the unknown matrices).

\item {\tt OPT:} a scalar corresponding to the optimal value of the minimization
problem $\Sigma$.
\end{itemize}
