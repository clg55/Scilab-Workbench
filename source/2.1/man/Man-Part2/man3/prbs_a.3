.SH NAME
prbs_a - pseudo random binary sequences generation 
.SH DESCRIPTION
[u]=prbs_a(n,nc,[ids])

generation of pseudo random binary sequences
  u=[u0,u1,...,u_(n-1)];
u takes values in {-1,1} and changes at most nc times its sign.
ids can be used to fix the date at which u must change its sign 
ids is then an integer vector with values in [1:n]
