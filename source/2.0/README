			      Scilab version 2.0
			      ******************
			       31 October 1994

******************************************************************************
			      INSTALLATION GUIDE
******************************************************************************

0 - COPYRIGHT NOTICE
********************

To use Scilab, you need to fill and return the end of the file notice.tex 
(TeX version to be compiled) or notice.ps (postscript file).

******************************************************************************

In the following, all the paths are relative to the Scilab directory 
(scilab-2.0 directory).

I - TO COMPILE AND INSTALL SCILAB
*********************************

 A - IF YOU GET A COMPILED VERSION
 ---------------------------------
   1 - Change the variable SCIDIR in the file Path.incl to make sure that 
       this variable is the path of the Scilab directory 
       (scilab-2.0 directory).

   2 - Execute only "make" command in the scripts directory.
  
 B - IF YOU GET A SOURCE VERSION
 -------------------------------
   This distribution has been tested on the following machines:
    HP9000, SUN Sparcstation (Sun OS), IBM RS6000, DEC mips, DEC alpha 
    and PC linux.

   You need X Window (X11R4 or X11R5), xmkmf (a script shell for creating 
    a Makefile from an Imakefile), C compiler and fortran compiler.
   If you run X11R4, you also need Athena Widgets libraries libXaw.a and
   libXmu.a   

   1 - Change the variable SCIDIR in the file Path.incl to make sure that 
       this variable is the path of the Scilab directory 
       (scilab-2.0 directory).

       If you run X11R4, see the file Imake.incl.

   2 - Execute the following commands in the Scilab directory:
	xmkmf
	make Makefiles 
	make depend
	make

     This will create new Makefiles for your computer, make dependencies,
       compile Scilab and install it. 

   3 - If you want to recompile Scilab after modification, execute only 
       the "make" command.

       If you want to clean all executable, object files and libraries 
       and then recompile Scilab, execute the following commands:
	make distclean
	make

   4 - To print your postscript figures you may need to edit and
       modify the macro macros/xdess/xbasimp.sci to specify
       your default printer.

  (5) - Note that the macros macros/util/edit and 
        macros/util/manedit assume that your default editor 
        is emacs. You may change this (or explicitly specify your
        editor when you invoke these macros).

   6  - COLOR RESOURCES: If you have a color display and you are running
        at least X11R5, you may want to add lines like: 
        #ifdef COLOR
        *customization: -color
        #endif
        to your personal resources file.  This will allow you to get the
        color-related resources for not only SCILAB but for every program 
        which sets up its own color resources. 
        Versions of X earlier than X11R5 do not support the customization 
        resource.  If you are on one of those, you will have to include the 
        color resources (X11-defaults/*-color )in your personal 
        resources file.
******************************************************************************
II - KNOWN PROBLEMS
*******************
   0 - C routines are not ANSI. Add a specific option if your C compiler
       is ANSI (e.g.  gcc -traditional).

   1 - If there is something wrong when you open the scilab window 
       then check your .Xdefault file.

   2 - The fortran compiler version 1.3.1 of SUN Sparcstations has a bug:
       reading or writing (with implicit loop) arrays  bigger than 4096 
       elements does not work. This may cause Scilab to abort.
       The solution is to upgrade your fortran compiler, for instance get 
       version 1.4 (or use version 1.3.1 with object file "recio.o" from 
       newer version).

   3 - Sometimes, Athena widgets libraries libXaw.a and libXmu.a and 
       corresponding include files are not provided within your X11 
       installation. 
       If you are under X11R5, these libraries are given for convenience
       with Scilab and the default is to use them. If you want to use yours,
       see the file Imake.incl and comment the appropriate line.
       If you are under X11R4, you NEED to have these libraries and you 
       have to comment the appropriate lines in Imake.incl.

   4 - For DEC ALPHA station you must use the 4.3 version of the fortran 
       compiler (the 3.3 version aborts on floating point exceptions).
       Incremental link does not work yet on DEC ALPHA 
   
   5 - If you have any problem or suggestion to improve Scilab
       send him an e-mail:
       
                          scilab@inria.fr

******************************************************************************
III - TO RUN SCILAB
*******************

Run Scilab by executing "scilab" (shell script in bin).
Use  "scilab -help" to get manual page for scilab command options.

******************************************************************************
IV - DOCUMENTATION
****************** 

In addition to Scilab online documentation, you will find
documentation in:
		doc/intro (compressed file intro.ps.Z) and 
		man/LaTex-doc (compressed file Docu.ps.Z).

******************************************************************************
VI - TO CREATE YOUR OWN CUSTOMIZED SCILAB
*****************************************
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   USE YOUR OWN FORTRAN ROUTINES IN SCILAB
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Directory SCIDIR/routines

stack.h    : this file is included in many fortran programs of subdirectories
             of "SCIDIR/routines". The size of the internal Scilab stack is 
             defined here. This is given in the parameter vsiz. 
             The default value is 300000. You can change it.

Directory SCIDIR/routines/default

matusr.f   : interface to add your own commands to Scilab (see the user 
             command).
interf.f   :interface for fast call to a fortran routine (see the fort command
            and the link command)
 
Other routines in this directory are used to interface external fortran
routines for use with the functions ode (non linear simulation), optim (non
linear optimization), intg (definite integrals), impl (implicit systems) and
schur (schur form with ordering defined by a fortran routine).
	
To use your own routines you need to replace the 
code .o in the directory SCIDIR/routines/default by your own code, or use 
shell command "scilab -link <object-files>" (type "scilab -help scilab" for 
help).

The libraries are the following:

    - system.a is the interpreter.
    - interf.a is the set of routines which interface the interpreter with
              the calculation routines.
    - system2.a is a set of utility routines for the interpreter.
    - control.a, signal.a, poly.a, optim.a, integ.a, sparse.a and calelm.a 
              are the routines for numerical calculations.
    - X11G.a  and xwindow.a are the routines for graphics.
    - sun.a contains specific routines for Unix (some of them are not 
              portable e.g. the incremental linking routines).
    - xsci.a contains routines which describes xwindow Scilab main window.
    - comm.a contains routines for interprocess communication.
    - metanet.a contains routines for Metanet. 
    - intersci.a contains routines for Intersci.
    - libXaw.a and libXmu.a are Athena widgets libraries (optional).
