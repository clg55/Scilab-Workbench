.SH NAME
% - percent
.SH DESCRIPTION
Some predefined variables begin with \fV%\fR, such as
\fV%i\fR (for \fVsqrt(-1)\fR), \fV%inf\fR (for \fVInfinity\fR), \fV%pi\fR (for \fV3.14...\fR),
\fV%T\fR (for the boolean variable \fV"true"\fR),...
.LP
In addition, functions whose names begin with \fV%\fR are special : 
they are used for coding (extensions of usual) operations .
.LP
For example the function \fV%rmr\fR performs the multiplication (\fVm\fR)
operation \fVx*y\fR for \fVx\fR and \fVy\fR rational matrices (\fVr\fR).
The coding conventions are given by the readme file in 
directory \fVSCIDIR/macros/percent\fR.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
x1=list('x',1,2);
x2=list('x',2,3);
deff('x=%xmx(x1,x2)','x=list(''x'',x1(2)*x2(2),x2(3)*x2(3))');
x1*x2
