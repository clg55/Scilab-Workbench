trianfml(1)                    Scilab Function                    trianfml(1)
NAME
  trianfml - symbolic triangularization

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [f [,sexp]]=trianfml(f [,sexp])

DESCRIPTION
  Triangularization of the symbolic matrix f ; triangularization is performed
  by elementary row operations; sexp is a set of common expressions stored by
  the algorithm.

EXAMPLE
  A=['1','2';'a','b']
  W=trianfml([A,string(eye(2,2))])
  U=W(:,3:4)
  a=5;b=6;
  A=evstr(A)
  U=evstr(U)
  U*A
  evstr(W(:,1:2))

SEE ALSO
  addf, mulf, solve, trisolve
