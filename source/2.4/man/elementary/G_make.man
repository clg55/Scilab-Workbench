.SH DESCRIPTION
On Unix like systems (i.e unix or windows/gcwin32) \fVG_make\fR calls
the \fVmake\fR utility for building target \fVfiles\fR and returns
the value of \fVfiles\fR in the variable \fVRfiles\fR. On windows platforms, (i.e when
Scilab was compiled with Microsoft VisualC++). \fVG_make\fR calls
the \fVnmake\fR utility for building target \fVdllname\fR and it
returns the value of \fVdllname\fR in the variable \fVRfiles\fR. 
Of course \fVG_make\fR will work if apropriate Makefiles are 
provided in the current Scilab directory. 
.LP
\fVG_make\fR can be used to provide OS independant call to addinter. 
and such examples can be found in the directory
\fVSCIDIR/examples/addinter-examples\fR
