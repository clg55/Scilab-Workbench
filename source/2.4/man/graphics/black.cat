NAME
  black - Black's diagram (Nichols chart)

CALLING SEQUENCE
  black( sl,[fmin,fmax] [,step] [,comments] )
  black( sl,frq [,comments] )
  black(frq,db,phi [,comments])
  black(frq,repf  [,comments])

PARAMETERS

  sl        : list ( linear system syslin)

  fmin,fmax : real scalars (frequency bounds)

  frq       : row vector or matrix (frequencies)

  db,phi    : row vectors or matrices (modulus, phase)

  repf      : row vectors or matrices (complex frequency response)

  step      : real

  comments  : string

DESCRIPTION
  Black's diagram (Nichols'chart) for a linear system sl.  sl can be a
  continuous-time or discrete-time SIMO system (see syslin).  In case of
  multi-output the outputs are plotted with different symbols.
  The frequencies are given by the bounds fmin,fmax (in Hz) or by a row-
  vector (or a matrix for multi-output) frq.
  step is the ( logarithmic ) discretization step. (see calfrq for the choice
  of default value).
  comments  is a vector of character strings (captions).
  db,phi are the matrices of modulus (in Db) and phases (in degrees). (One
  row for each response).
  repf  matrix of complex numbers. One row for each response.

  To plot the grid of iso-gain and iso-phase of y/(1+y) use chart().
  Default values for fmin and fmax are 1.d-3, 1.d+3 if sl is continuous-time
  or 1.d-3, 0.5 if sl is discrete-time.

EXAMPLE
  s=poly(0,'s')
  h=syslin('c',(s^2+2*0.9*10*s+100)/(s^2+2*0.3*10.1*s+102.01))
  chart();
  sstr='(s^2+2*0.9*10*s+100)/(s^2+2*0.3*10.1*s+102.01)';
  black(h,0.01,100,sstr);
  h1=h*syslin('c',(s^2+2*0.1*15.1*s+228.01)/(s^2+2*0.9*15*s+225))
  xbasc()
  black([h1;h],0.01,100,['h1';'h'])
