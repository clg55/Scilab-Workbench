.SH NAME
pause - pause mode, invoke keyboard
.SH DESCRIPTION
Switch to the \fVpause\fR mode;
inserted in the code of a function, \fVpause\fR interrupts the execution
of the function: one receives a prompt symbol which indicates
the level of the \fVpause\fR (e.g. \fV-1->\fR). The user is
then in a new session in which all the lower-level variables
(and in particular all the variable of the function) are available.
To return to lower session enter \fV"return"\fR
.LP
In this mode, \fV[...]=return(...) \fR
returns the variables of the argument \fV(...)\fR to lower session with 
names in the output \fV [...]\fR. Otherwise, the lower-level variables
are protected and cannot be modified.
.LP
The \fVpause\fR is extremely useful for debugging purposes.
.LP
This mode is killed by the command \fV"abort"\fR.
