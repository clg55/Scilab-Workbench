addinter(1)                    Scilab Function                    addinter(1)
NAME
  addinter - new functions interface incremental linking at run time

CALLING SEQUENCE
  addinter(files,spname,fcts)

PARAMETERS

  files     : a character string or a vector of character string contain
            object files used to define the new Scilab interface routine
            (interface code, user routines or libraries, system libraries).

  spname    : a character string. Name of interface routine entry point

  fcts      : vector of character strings. The name of new Scilab function
            implemented in the new interface (in  fin  the order ).

DESCRIPTION
  addinter performs incremental linking of a compiled C or Fortran new Scilab
  interface routine (see intersci documentation) and define corresponding
  scilab functions.
  For machines using dlopen functionality one can unlink an interface with
  ulink ( use the command link('show') to get the number of the shared
  library ). And to reload a new version of an interface a call to ulink is
  necessary to get rid of the old version.
  See link for more precision on use.
