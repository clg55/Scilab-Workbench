free of charge.

In the following, all the paths are relative to the Scilab directory 
(scilab-2.4 directory).

I - TO INSTALL SCILAB
*********************

 A - IF YOU HAVE A COMPILED VERSION
 ----------------------------------
   Simply do, in Scilab directory:
	make
  
 B - IF YOU HAVE A SOURCE VERSION
 --------------------------------
   This distribution has been tested on the following machines:
   HP9000, SUN Sparcstation (Sun OS and Solaris 5.*), IBM RS6000, 
   DEC alpha, SGI and PC linux (a.out and ELF).

   You need X Window (X11R4, X11R5 or X11R6), Athena Widgets libraries, 
   C compiler and fortran compiler.

   1 - Configure your system by issuing the following command in the Scilab 
       directory:
	./configure

       This will create and/or modify a few Makefile and other files for your 
       system.
       You can give options to configure command, see below.

   2 - Do in the Scilab directory:
	make all

       This will compile Scilab and set everything.

   Configure options:
   ------------------
	-enable-debug: compile with "-g" option and do not optimize

	-with-gcc: use gcc C compiler (note that the compilation options
          have not been tested on all machines, see C below)

	-with-g77: use g77 fortran compiler (note that the compilations
          options have not been tested on all machines, see C below)

	-with-gnu: use gcc C compiler and g77 fortran compiler (note that 
          the compilation options have not been tested on all machines, 
          see C below)

        -x-libraries=DIR: X Window library files are in DIR
        -x-includes=DIR: X Window include files are in DIR

	-with-local-Xaw: compile and use Athena Widgets libraries given 
          with Scilab (don't use then for X11R4); configure chooses local
          Athena Widgets library when needed, so the use of this option is not
          recommanded (see below KNOWN PROBLEMS 3).

        -with-tk: compile with TCL/TK library. You must have libraries of 
          TCL/TK 8.x and corresponding include files installed in standard
          directory (configure is looking for them).
          If your libraries and include files are in customized places, 
          you can specify them by hand with the following arguments:
               -with-tcl-library=TCL_LIB_DIR: Tcl library is in TCL_LIB_DIR
               -with-tcl-include=TCL_INC_DIR: Tcl include is in TCL_INC_DIR
               -with-tk-library=TK_LIB_DIR: Tk library is in TK_LIB_DIR
               -with-tk-include=TK_INC_DIR: Tk include is in TK_INC_DIR

 C - CHANGING THE COMPILATION OPTIONS (source version only)
 ------------------------------------
    You may want to change the options used to compile Scilab, names of the
    compilers, compilation options, linker options, and so on; you can easily 
    do that.

    The main Makefile of Scilab includes "Makefile.incl" and
    "config/Makefile.<machine>":
      "Makefile.incl" contains all the compilation options
      "config/Makefile.<machine>" is only used for the link of the executable 
          "scilex" of Scilab

   The file "Makefile.incl" is included by all the Makefiles of the 
   distribution, so it is THE place where you can change compilation 
   options (it is self documented).

   Note that "Makefile.incl" is automatically generated by "configure"
   from "Makefile.incl.in", so your modifications of "Makefile.incl" are
   discarded every time you run "configure". 
   Users knowing the way "configure" works may want to modify directly the 
   "configure" file.
   Even more, users knowing the way "autoconf" works may want to modify 
   the "configure.in" file and then run "autoconf" (version 2.12) to generate
   the "configure" file.

 D - CUSTOMIZING YOUR SCILAB
 ---------------------------
   1 - If you want to recompile Scilab after modifications, execute only 
       the "make all" command in Scilab directory (source version only).

       If you want to clean all executable, object files and libraries 
       and then recompile Scilab, execute the following commands
       (source version only):
	make distclean
	make all

   2 - To print your postscript figures, the list of printers is defined
       in the environment variable "PRINTERS" or in the beginning of 
       the shell script "bin/scilab".

   3 - Note that the functions "macros/util/edit" and
       "macros/util/manedit" assume that your default editor 
       is emacs. You may change this in the corresponding function (or 
       explicitly specify your editor when you invoke these functions).

   4 - Icons for windows managers: icons for Scilab, Scilab graphics windows
       and Metanet graphics windows are given in the X11_defaults
       subdirectory. See the README in this subdirectory.

   5 - COLOR RESOURCES: if you want to change the colors of your 
       customization you need to modify the files in the X11_defaults
       subdirectory (essentially the Xscilab file) or to copy the same
       color resources in your personal resource file (home directory).

******************************************************************************
II - KNOWN PROBLEMS AND REMARKS
*******************************
   0 - Note that C routines are not ANSI.

   1 - If there is something wrong when you open the scilab window 
       check your ".Xdefault" file.

   2 - The fortran compiler version 1.3.1 of SUN Sparcstations has a bug:
       reading or writing (with implicit loop) arrays  bigger than 4096 
       elements does not work. This may cause Scilab to abort.
       The solution is to upgrade your fortran compiler, for instance get 
       version 1.4 (or use version 1.3.1 with object file "recio.o" from 
       newer version).

   3 - Athena Widgets libraries libXaw.a and libXmu.a (and corresponding 
       include files) are not systematically provided in some X11 
       installations. If you are using X11R5 or X11R6, these libraries are 
       provided for convenience with Scilab.
       "configure" first tries to find existing Athena Widgets libraries.
       If none are found and X Window release is not X11R4, it uses
       local Athena Widgets libraries. Otherwise an error is issued.
       You can impose the use of local Athena Widgets libraries by using
       the option "-with-local-Xaw" with "configure".

       On some IBM RS6000 there exists a compatibility problem between the
       X11-Mit distribution and the IBM version. If your system runs the IBM
       X11 release you must use the IBM libXaw.a and libXmu.a libraries.

   4 - For DEC ALPHA workstation you must use the 3.4 or newer version
       of the fortran compiler (the 3.3 version aborts on floating
       point exceptions). You are encouraged to use the OSF 3.0 system
       release and the fortran 3.5 release (the incremental link works
       fine as well as all the floating point exceptions).

   5 - For HP workstation, programs to be incrementally linked should
       be compiled with the option "+z" or "+Z".

   6 - If you have any problem or suggestion to improve Scilab
       send an email to:
       
                          Scilab@inria.fr

       or better post a message to newsgroup:

******************************************************************************
III - TO RUN SCILAB
*******************

Run Scilab by executing "scilab" (shell script in bin).

If the name of the directory of Scilab distribution is not the same on 
your machine than on the machine where Scilab was installed, define the
environment variable SCI to point to the directory of Scilab distribution.
In a sh like shell, do:
 SCI=<name of the directory>
 export SCI
In a csh like shell, do:
 setenv SCI <name of the directory>
