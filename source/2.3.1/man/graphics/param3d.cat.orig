param3d(2)                     Scilab Function                     param3d(2)
NAME
  param3d - set of points or parametric curves in 3-D

CALLING SEQUENCE
  param3d(x,y,z,[theta,alpha,leg,flag,ebox]

PARAMETERS

  x,y,z          : three matrices of the same size (considered as vectors
                 with the Fortran storage convention)  (points of the
                 parametric curve)

  theta, alpha   : gives the coordinates in spherical angle of the observa-
                 tion point

  leg            : string describing the caption for each axis, the different
                 fields in the string are separated by the symbol @, for
                 example : "X@Y@Z"

  flag =[type,box] :
                 where  type and  box have the same meaning as in plot3d

  ebox           : a vector of size (1,6) which gives the boundaries of the
                 plot [xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax,zmin,zmax] when the value of type
                 is 1

DESCRIPTION
  param3d() is used to obtain a graphic of a parametric curve in R3, and can
  also be used to see a set of points in R3

  Enter the command param3d() to see a demo.

EXAMPLE
  t=0:0.1:5*%pi;
  param3d(sin(t),cos(t),t/10,35,45,"X@Y@Z",[2,3])
  xbasc();
  xset("dashes",-3)
  param3d(rand(1,100),rand(1,100),rand(1,100),35,45,"X@Y@Z",[2,3])
