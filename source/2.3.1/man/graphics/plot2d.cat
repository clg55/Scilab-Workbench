NAME
  plot2d - multiple plot of functions

CALLING SEQUENCE
  plot2d(x,y,[style,strf,leg,rect,nax])
  plot2d(y);

PARAMETERS

  x,y       : two matrices of the same size [nl,nc]. nc gives the number of
            curves and nl gives the number of points for each curve. If nl=1,
            it's assumed that there's only one curve of nc points.

            nc
              : is the number of curves

            nl
              : is the number of points of each curve for example : x=[
              1:10;1:10]',y= [ sin(1:10);cos(1:10)]'

  style     : is a real vector of size (1,nc). the style to use for curve j
            is defined by size(j).

            - if style[i] is negative the curve is plotted using the mark of
              Id style[i],

            - if style[i] is strictly positive a dashed or plain line of id
              (or color)abs(style[i]) is used.

            - When only one curve is drawn style can be of size (1,2)
              [style,pos] where style is used to specify the style and pos is
              an integer in the range 1,6 which specifies a position to use
              for the caption (this can be useful when a user wants to draw
              multiple curves on a plot by calling the function plot several
              times and wants to give a caption for each curve)

  strf      : is a string of length 3 "xyz"

            x : captions are displayed if x is the character 1. Captions are
              given by the string leg "leg1@leg2@...."

            y : controls the computation of the frame

              y=0
                : the current boundaries ( set by a previous call to an other
                high level plotting function ) are used.

              y=1
                : the argument rect is used to specify the boundaries of the
                plot.  rect=[xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax]

              y=2
                : the boundaries of the plot are computed using max and min
                values of x and y.

              y=3
                : like y=1 but produces isoview scaling

              y=4
                : like y=2 but produces isoview scaling

              y=5
                : like y=1 but the boundaries and nax can be changed to pro-
                duce pretty graduations.  This mode is used when the zoom
                button is activated.

              y=6
                : like y=2 but the boundaries and nax can be changed to pro-
                duce pretty graduations.  This mode is used when the zoom
                button is activated.

            z : controls the display of information on the frame around the
              plot

              z=1
                : an axis is drawn the number of tics can be specified by the
                nax argument. nax  is a vector with four entries
                [nx,Nx,ny,Ny] where nx (ny) is the number of subgrads on the
                x (y) axis and Nx (Ny) is the number of graduations  on the x
                (y) axis
              z=2
                : the plot is only surrounded by a box

              _o_t_h_e_r _v_a_l_u_e
                Nothing around the plot

DESCRIPTION
  plot2d simultaneously plot a set of 2D curves which are given by a set of
  points using piecewise linear plotting

  Enter the command plot2d() to see a demo.

EXAMPLE
  x=0:0.1:2*%pi;
  //simple plot
  plot2d(sin(x));
  //multiple plot
  xbasc();
  plot2d([x;x;x]',[sin(x);sin(2*x);sin(3*x)]');
  //multiple plot with captions
  xbasc();
  plot2d([x;x;x]',[sin(x);sin(2*x);sin(3*x)]',...
  [1,2,3],"111","L1@L2@L3",[0,-2,2*%pi,2],[2,10,2,10]);
  // isoview
  xbasc();
  plot2d(x',sin(x)',1,'041')
  // auto scale
  xbasc();
  plot2d(x',sin(x)',1,'061')
