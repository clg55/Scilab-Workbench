NAME
  CLKSPLIT_f - Scicos event split block

DIALOGUE PARAMETERS
  None.

DESCRIPTION
  This block is an event split block with an input and two outputs. The out-
  puts reproduces the event the input port on each output ports. Strictly
  speaking, CLKSPLIT is not a Scicos block because it is discarded at the
  compilation phase. This block is automatically created when creating a new
  link issued from a link.

  The inputs and output of CLKSPLIT are synchronized.
