lu(G)                          Scilab Function                          lu(G)
NAME
  lu - LU factors of Gaussian elimination

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [L,U]= lu(A)

PARAMETERS

  A    : real or complex square matrix (n x n)

  L,U     : two real or complex matrices  (n x n)

DESCRIPTION
  [L,U]= lu(A) produces two matrices L and U such that A = L*U with U upper
  triangular and E*L  lower triangular for a permutation matrix E. If A has
  rank k, rows k+1 to n of U are zero.

Remark
  E is not returned by LU: as such this primitive is not interesting (old
  stuff)
