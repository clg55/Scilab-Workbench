			Scilab 2.3.1
			============
	Scilab-2.3.1 is not a major release just a patch for
correcting some bugs along with very few modifications and
additions. 

LINUX
=====
	geci: Bug correction for linux when no hostname in "/etc/host".
	
	xsci: Bug correction for printing and export menus.

SUNOS 4.1.3
===========
	Link: bug correction for "link" on sunos 4.1.3. 

SCICOS
======
	This patch allows to properly handle the case where the graphic
	image of a scicos palette (*.pal file) is missing.

	It corrects a bug when user loads and wants to simulate the image of a
	scicos super block and 
        corrects an error which occurs when user
	refuses ("Cancel") that scicos modifies users' ".scilab" file in
	"palette edition" mode.

	Bug Correction for use of incrementally linked simulation routines.

	To allow any data type for discrete state with scilab simulation
	function, and modipar bug correction.

	Bug correction in "eval" for diagrams including GENERIC blocks.

	To have true circles for SUM, PROD and SPLIT icons.

	Bug in scope's event handling corrected.

	"Read from file" block "autoexec" corrected case when output event is
	fed into input event.

	Bug in compiler corrected for blocks with more than one inputs
	and outputs.

	New blocks added.

	But problem remains with "Eval". Must do a manual compile after
	each "Eval" if not abnormal behavior. Cause is not found yet.

SPARSE MATRICES 
=============== 
	Some modifications to:

	properly handle sparse boolean matrix with no "true" element as "if"
	or "while" logical expression,

	correct a bug in "find" applied to boolean matrices and called with
	two lhs arguments such as   [i,j]=find(rand(3,3)>0.2),

	properly handle comparisons (== <>) between sparse  1x1   matrices
	and empty matrices;
	sparse(1)==[] now answers %f instead of (0,0) False sparse matrix.

	Bug correction in clean function for sparse matrices.

ERROR RECOVERY & SCICOS
=======================
	Better error recovery during deff getf and comp in complex situations
	encountered in particular with scicos "scifunc" block.

MISC
====
	sci2exp bug in translation of non degenerate standard matrix
	such as sci2exp(rand(3,3)).

	Bug corrected in time_id for non strictly proper systems.

	Bug corrected in readb.

	".^" handling  corrected in macr2lst.

	".'" handling for non conjugate transpose added.
	
	sum(a,n), prod(a,n) meaning changed

GRAPHICS
========
	Bug in [....]=xclick(1) corrected.

	plot3d1 : the sign of the  mode attribute is now used.

	Modification to have full A4 plot output in landscape mode. 

	Modification in the Fig driver to properly center marks at a 
	desired position.
	
	B&white display using Scicos corrected.

HELP
====
	Using  the help menu + the interactive help or apropos 
	command could crash Scilab; this bug has been fixed.
