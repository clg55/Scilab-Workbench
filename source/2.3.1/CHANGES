2.1 to 2.2 Major improvements
=============================
- New simulation tools
      * Scicos hybrid connected object simulator (Beta test version).

      * A discrete/continuous ode solver odedc has been added.

      * All ode solvers parameters are now available through %ODEOPTIONS
        variable and odeoptions function.

      * addition of DAE solver with root finder (dasrt).

- New version of Metanet

- New GUI utilities
      * Choice menu for xset parameters (see xset() ).

      * Menus to print/export graphics.

      * It is now possible to interactively zoom 2d plots and rotate 3d
        plots using the graphic window buttons.

      * Function to create and handle new buttons (see addmenu).

      * Function to get filenames (see xgetfile).

      * It is now possible to kill graphic windows using menu or xdel
        function.

- Optimization
      * New versions of optimization routines.

      * Non differentiable optimization added (optim('nd',...).

- Miscellaneous
      * scilab stack size may now be allocated at startup time and within
        scilab (see stacksize).

      * It is now possible to read and write data in integer format.

      * a new data type "typed-list" designed for "soft coded"
        operations (see tlist).

      * all the documentation of Scilab in Postscript compressed files 
        is no longer distributed with Scilab distribution. You will find 
        it by anonymous ftp on "ftp.inria.fr:/INRIA/Projects/Meta2/Scilab/doc"
        (internet# 192.93.2.54).

2.1 to 2.2 Incompatiblities
===========================
- Due to an initial inconsistency in  typed lists, a new data type 
  ("typed-list") has been created to handle new objects associated 
  with "soft coded" operations. The old way still works, but will be
  discarded in the next realease.

- x(:) extraction/insertion has been changed for string and polynomial 
  matrices do be coherent with the usual matrices.

- error message 48 split in 240 (read) et 241 (write)
  check errcatch(48,..) usage in macros

- an argument has been added to xsegs to set line style, It is no more
  possible to use xset('dashes',n);xsegs(..) to set line styles.

- Most of xset parameters are now attached to their particular window.

- plot3di, fac3di interactive functions have been replaced by plot3d
  and fac3d.

- Metanet has been fully revisited, many metanet related functions
  have been corrected and renamed.

2.2 to 2.3 improvements
=======================
*PORTABILITY
- Scilab may now be compiled on  Window95/NT patforms (beta test
version)

*SYNTAX
-------
- .^ operand added

- operation consistency revisited

- $ formal symbol may be used to represent matrix row or column
  dimension and list size within isertion and extraction operations

- It is now possible to assign a list element of index greater than
  the list size+1

- list entries designation by their names

- Square matrix elementary functions renamed to avoid inconsistencies

- Comparison between empty matrix and scalar returns an empty matrix
  instead of an error. find([]) also return an empty matrix instead of
  an error. 

- interpretation of [x (a+b)] and [a + b] modified to be more
  convenient 

- Hierarchic extraction/insertion of sub-list entries see 
  help insertion and extraction

- It is now possible to remove lines or column of a matrix inserting
an empty matrix

*NEW TOOLBOXES
----------------
- Beta test interprocess connection toolbox has been added see "help
communications"

*SCICOS
-------
- vector valued link may be defined between blocks
- Formal expression of block parameters and context
- Customisable block shapes

*METANET
--------
- many new functions

*GRAPHICS
---------
- It is now possible to set colors for each 3D facets

- It is now possible to change the current colormap and to define as
  many colors for scilab graphics as your system.

- It is now possible to interactively zoom a part of a drawn 2D plot
  and to change 3D plot point of view

*MISC
-----
- Help manager modified to simplify addition of users toolboxes helps

- Many helps revisited and complemented with examples

- sort had been extended to character strings

- matrix functions such as max, min, sum, prod ... had been extended
  to column/row wise interpretation

- cumsum / cumprod added

- the $ character can be used to select the last entry of matrices

2.2 to 2.3 Incompatiblities
===========================
*SYNTAX
-------
- Square matrix elementary functions renamed to avoid inconsistencies
  ex: matrix square root must be called sqrtm(A). element wise square
  root must be called sqrt(A)
- old syntax for functions definition within file has been removed 
  use 
  function [....]=func(...)
  instead of
  //[....]=func(...)

- //end special interpretation suppressed

*GRAPHICS
---------
- Default colormap is different to the 2.2 colormap.

- Now colors are numbered from 1 to N instead of 0 to 16

- xrects(x,y,xget('white')+1) must be replaced by
  xrects(x,y,xget('lastpattern ')+1)

- plot2d style argument must be negated

*C/FORTRAN INTERFACE
--------------------

- Addition of new hard coded function has been slightly modified:
routines/default/fundef  has been modified to a C include file, newfun
program is no more needed.

-  hard coded external for non linear problems (ode, optim,....) hard
link mechanism has been modified. 

*METANET
--------
- metanet graph structures have been slighly modified (typed lists are used)
As a consequence, you have to change the following:
g('arc_number') => arc_number(g)
g('node_number') => node_number(g)

*SCICOS
-------
- Due to many changes old scicos diagrams may not work
