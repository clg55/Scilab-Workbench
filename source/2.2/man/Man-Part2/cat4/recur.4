recur(1)                       Scilab Function                       recur(1)






NAME
  recur - a bilinear recurrent equation

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [y]=recur(x0,var,k,n)
  [integr]=logr(k,var)

DESCRIPTION
  computes solutions of a bilinear recurrent equation
  x(i+1)=-x(i)*(k + sqrt(var)*br(i))
  with initial value x0 and driven by a white noise of variance var.

  Trajectories are drawn and the empirical Lyapunov exponent is returned (
  x(i) is not to much different from exp(y*i) )

  A theorical computation of the Lyapunov exponent is given by
  [integr]=logr(k,var)
