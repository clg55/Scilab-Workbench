obs_cont(1)                    Scilab Function                    obs_cont(1)






NAME
  obs_cont - a controlled-observed system

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [macr]=obs_cont(sysn)

PARAMETERS
  sysn : A Scilab string which gives the name of the controlled system.
  gaincom,gainobs
       : column vectors giving the requested gains
  macr : a new Scilab function which simulates the controlled observed sys-
       tem.
       [x1dot]=macr(t,x1,abruit,pas,n)
       x1=[x;xchap],

DESCRIPTION
  This macros return a new function which computes the controlled observed
  version of a linearised system around the (xe,ue) point.

  before calling this function, a noise vector br should be created.  the
  equilibrium point (xe,ue) should be given as a global Scilab.
   the linearised system $f,g,h$ and the two  gain matrices l,k are returned
  as global Scilab data.
