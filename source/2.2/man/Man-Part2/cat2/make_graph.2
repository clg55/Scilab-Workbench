make_graph(1)                  Scilab function                  make_graph(1)






NAME
  make_graph - make a graph-list

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [g] = make-graph(name,directed,n,tail,head)

PARAMETERS
  name : string, the name of the graph
  directed : integer, 0 or 1 according to the fact that the graph is
           undirected or directed
  n : integer, the number of nodes of the graph
  tail : row vector of the numbers of the tail nodes of the graph (its size
       is the number of edges of the graph)
  head : row vector of the numbers of the head nodes of the graph (its size
       is the number of edges of the graph)

DESCRIPTION
  make_graph makes a graph-list according to its arguments which are respec-
  tively the name of the graph, a flag for directed or undirected, the number
  of nodes and the row vectors tail and head. These are the minimal data
  needed or a graph.

EXAMPLE
  // creating a directed graph with 3 nodes and 4 arcs.
  g=make_graph('foo',1,3,[1,2,3,1],[2,3,1,3]);
