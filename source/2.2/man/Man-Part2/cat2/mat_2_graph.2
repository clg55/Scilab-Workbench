mat_2_graph(1)                 Scilab function                 mat_2_graph(1)






NAME
  mat_2_graph - graph from node-arc incidence matrix

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [g] = mat_2_graph(a,directed)

PARAMETERS
  a : sparse node-arc incidence matrix
  directed : integer, 0 or 1 according to the fact that the graph is
           undirected or directed
  g : graph-list

DESCRIPTION
  mat_2_graph computes the graph g correspponding to the node-arc incidence
  matrix a.  Note that a checking is made to insure that a is a sparse node-
  arc incidence matrix of a directed (directed=1) or undirected (directed=0)
  graph.

EXAMPLE
  g=load_graph(SCI+'/demos/metanet/colored');
  show_graph(g,'rep');
  a=graph_2_mat(g)
  g1=mat_2_graph(a,1)
  g1('node_x')=g('node_x'); g1('node_y')=g('node_y');
  show_graph(g1,'new');
