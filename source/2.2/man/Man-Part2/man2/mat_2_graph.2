.SH NAME
mat_2_graph - graph from node-arc incidence matrix
.SH CALLING SEQUENCE
.nf
[g] = mat_2_graph(a,directed)
.fi
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP 2
a
: sparse node-arc incidence matrix
.TP 9
directed
: integer, 0 or 1 according to the fact that the graph is undirected 
or directed
.TP 2
g
: graph-list
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fVmat_2_graph\fR computes the graph \fVg\fR correspponding to the node-arc 
incidence matrix \fVa\fR.
Note that a checking is made to insure that \fVa\fR is a sparse node-arc 
incidence matrix of a directed (\fVdirected=1\fR) or undirected 
(\fVdirected=0\fR) graph.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
g=load_graph(SCI+'/demos/metanet/colored');
show_graph(g,'rep');
a=graph_2_mat(g)
g1=mat_2_graph(a,1)
g1('node_x')=g('node_x'); g1('node_y')=g('node_y');
show_graph(g1,'new');
