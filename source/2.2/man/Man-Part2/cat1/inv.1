inv(G)                         Scilab Function                         inv(G)






NAME
  inv - matrix inverse

CALLING SEQUENCE
  inv(X)

PARAMETERS
  X    : real or complex square matrix, polynomial matrix, rational matrix in
       transfer or state-space representation.

DESCRIPTION
  inv(X) is the inverse of the square matrix X. A warning message is printed
  if X is badly scaled or nearly singular.
  For polynomial matrices or rational matrices in transfer representation,
  inv(X) is equivalent to invr(X).
  For linear systems in state-space representation (syslin list), invr(X) is
  equivalent to invsyslin(X).
