gschur(G)                      Scilab Function                      gschur(G)






NAME
  gschur - generalized Schur form (matrix pencils).

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [As,Es]=gschur(A,E)
  [As,Es,Q,Z]=gschur(A,E)
  [As,Es,Z,dim] = gschur(A,E,flag)
  [As,Es,Z,dim]= gschur(A,E,extern)

PARAMETERS
  A, E      : two real square matrices
  flag      : character string ('c' or 'd')
  extern    : Scilab ``external'' function (usual case). Could be also a list
            or a character string
  As,Es     : two real square matrices
  Q, Z      : two non-singular real matrices
  dim       : integer (dimension of subspace)

DESCRIPTION
  [1mSchur     form of matrix pencils (QZ algorithm)
  [0m[As,Es] = gschur(A,E)
  produces a quasi triangular As matrix and a triangular Es matrix which are
  the generalized Schur form of the pair A, E.
  [As,Es,Q,Z] = gschur(A,E)
  returns in addition two unitary matrices Q and Z such that As=Q*A*Z and
  Es=Q*E*Z.
  [1mOrdered stable form
  [0m[As,Es,Z,dim]     = gschur(A,E,'c')
  returns the real generalized Schur form of the pencil s*E-A. In addition,
  the dim first columns of Z span a basis of the right eigenspace  associated
  with eigenvalues with negative real parts (stable "continuous time" gen-
  eralized eigenspace).
  [As,Es,Z,dim] = gschur(A,E,'d')
  returns the real generalized Schur form of the pencil s*E-A. In addition,
  the dim first columns of Z make a basis of the right eigenspace  associated
  with eigenvalues with magnitude lower than 1 (stable "discrete time" gen-
  eralized eigenspace).
  [1mGeneral subspace
  [0m[As,Es,Z,dim]     = gschur(A,E,extern)
  returns the real generalized Schur form of the pencil s*E-A. In addition,
  the dim first columns of Z make a basis of the right eigenspace  associated
  with eigenvalues of the pencil which are selected according to a rule which
  is given by the scilab function extern.  (See schur for definition of this
  function).
