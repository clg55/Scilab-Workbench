hess(G)                        Scilab Function                        hess(G)






NAME
  hess - Hessenberg form

CALLING SEQUENCE
  H = hess(A)
  [U,H] = hess(A)

PARAMETERS
  A    : real or complex square matrix
  H    : real or complex square matrix
  U    : orthogonal or unitary square matrix

DESCRIPTION
  [U,H] = hess(A) produces a unitary matrix U and a Hessenberg matrix H so
  that A = U*H*U' and U'*U = Identity.  By itself, hess(A) returns H.
  The Hessenberg form of a matrix is zero below the first subdiagonal. If the
  matrix is symmetric or Hermitian, the form is tridiagonal.
