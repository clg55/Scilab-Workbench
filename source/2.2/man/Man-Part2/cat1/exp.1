exp(G)                         Scilab Function                         exp(G)






NAME
  exp - exponential, matrix exponential

CALLING SEQUENCE
  exp(X)

PARAMETERS
  X    : a vector or a square matrix with real or complex entries.
DESCRIPTION
  If X is a vector (or a [1mnon-square [0mmatrix) exp(X) is the (element-wise)
  exponential of the entries of X, e to the X.
  If X is a [1msquare [0mmatrix exp(X) is the matrix


  exp(X) = I + X + X^2 /2 + ...

  The computation is performed by first block-diagonalizing X and then apply-
  ing a Pade approximation on each block.
