sva(1)                         Scilab Function                         sva(1)






NAME
  sva - singular value approximation

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [U,s,V]=sva(A,k)
  [U,s,V]=sva(A,tol)

PARAMETERS
  A       : real or complex matrix
  k       : integer
  tol     : nonnegative real number

DESCRIPTION
  Singular value approximation.
  [U,S,V]=sva(a,k)
   with k an integer >=1, returns U,S and V such that B=U*S*V' is the bast L2
  approximation of A with rank(B)=k.
  [U,S,V]=sva(A,tol)
   with tol a real number, returns U,S and V such that B=U*S*V' such that
  L2-norm of  A-B is at most tol.
