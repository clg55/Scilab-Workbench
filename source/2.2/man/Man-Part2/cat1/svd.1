svd(G)                         Scilab Function                         svd(G)






NAME
  svd  -  singular value decomposition

CALLING SEQUENCE
  s=svd(X)
  [U,S,V]=svd(X)
  [U,S,V,rk]=svd(X [,tol])

PARAMETERS
  X         : a real or complex matrix
  s         : real vector (singular values)
  S         : real diagonal matrix (singular values)
  U,V       : orthogonal or unitary square matrices (singular vectors).
  tol       : real number

DESCRIPTION
  [U,S,V] = svd(X) produces a diagonal matrix S , of the same dimension as X
  and with nonnegative diagonal elements in decreasing order, and unitary
  matrices U and V so that X = U*S*V'.
  s = svd(X) by itself, returns a vector s containing the singular values.
  [U,S,V,rk]=svd(X,tol) gives in addition rk, the numerical rank of X i.e.
  the number of singular values larger than tol.
  The default value of tol is the same as in rank.
