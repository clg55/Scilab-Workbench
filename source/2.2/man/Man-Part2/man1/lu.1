.SH NAME
lu - LU factors of Gaussian elimination
.SH CALLING SEQUENCE
.nf
[L,U]= lu(A)
.fi
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
A 
: real or complex square matrix (n x n)
.TP 8
L,U
: two real or complex matrices  (n x n)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.Vb [L,U]= lu(A)
produces two matrices \fVL\fR and \fVU\fR such that \fVA = L*U\fR
with \fVU\fR upper triangular and \fVE*L\fR  lower triangular for 
a permutation matrix E. If \fVA\fR has rank \fVk\fR, rows \fVk+1\fR
to \fVn\fR of \fVU\fR are zero.
.SH Remark
\fVE\fR is not returned by LU: as such this primitive is not 
interesting (old stuff)
.SH SEE ALSO
