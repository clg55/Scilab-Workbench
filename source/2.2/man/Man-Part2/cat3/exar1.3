exar1(1)                       Scilab Function                       exar1(1)






NAME
  exar1 - armax identification example

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [z,zd,u,ar]=exar1()

PARAMETERS
  z    : output without noise.
  zd   : output with noise
  u    : entry ( PRBS)
  ar   : the armax description ( see armac)

DESCRIPTION
  An  Example of ARMAX identification ( K.J. Astrom) The armax process is
  described by :
      a=[1,-2.851,2.717,-0.865]
      b=[0,1,1,1]
      d=[1,0.7,0.2] and the entry is a pseudo random binary signal.  a sample
  of the processed is generated and used to identify the parameters using
  armax. Since in this example the noise is a coloured noise armax will give
  biased estimators
