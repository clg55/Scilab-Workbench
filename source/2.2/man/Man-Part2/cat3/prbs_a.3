prbs_a(1)                      Scilab Function                      prbs_a(1)






NAME
  prbs_a - pseudo random binary sequences generation

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [u]=prbs_a(n,nc,[ids])

DESCRIPTION
  generation of pseudo random binary sequences
   u=[u0,u1,...,u_(n-1)]; u takes values in {-1,1} and changes at most nc
  times its sign.  ids can be used to fix the date at which u must change its
  sign ids is then an integer vector with values in [1:n].
