.SH NAME
TCLSS - Scicos jump continuous-time linear state-space system
.SH DESCRIPTION
This block realizes a continuous-time linear state-space system
with the possibility of jumps in the state. The number of inputs
to this block equals the number of inputs of the linear system plus
n the number of states of the linear system. When an event arrives
at the unique event input port of this block, the state of the
system jumps to the value present on the last n inputs of the block.
The system is defined by the (A,B,C,D) matrices and the initial
state x0. The dimensions must be compatible. The number of inputs
and outputs are adjusted automatically.
