SAWTOOTH_f(5)                   Scicos Block                   SAWTOOTH_f(5)






NAME
  SAWTOOTH - Scicos sawtooth wave generator

DESCRIPTION
  This block is a sawtooth wave generator: output is (t-t_i) from ti to
  t_(i+1) where t_i and t_(i+1) denote the times of two successive input
  events.

DIALOG PARAMETERS
  Block label    : A string defining the block label. This label is placed
                 under the block.
  dt             : a scalar. If 0, no ouput event port exists. If dt>0, an
                 output event port exists. This port is initially fired and
                 an event is generated dt after every input event. By feeding
                 back this event output to the event input, a self clocked
                 sawtooth wave generator can be costructed.
