NAME
  SCOPE - Scicos visualization block

DESCRIPTION
  This block realizes the visualization of the evolution of the signals on
  the standard input port(s) at instants of events on the event input port.

DIALOG PARAMETERS
  Block label         : A string defining the block label. This label is
                      written under the block.
  Number of inputs    : an integer, the number of input ports
  Curve colors        : a vector of integers. The i-th element is the color
                      number (<0) or dash type (>0) used to draw the evolu-
                      tion of the i-th input port signal. See plot2d for
                      color (dash type) definitions.
  Output window number
                      : The number of graphic window used for the display. It
                      is often good to use high values to avoid conflict with
                      palettes and Super Block windows. If you have more than
                      one scope, make sure they don't have the same window
                      numbers (unless superposition of the curves is
                      desired).
  Ymin, Ymax          : Minimum and maximum values of the input; used to set
                      up the Y-axis of the plot in the graphics window.
  Refresh period      : Maximum value on the X-axis (time). The plot is
                      redrawn when time reaches a multiple of this value.
  Buffer size         : To improve efficiency it is possible to buffer the
                      input data. The drawing is only done after each Buffer
                      size call to the block.
  dt                  : If dt is 0, time is used for the X-axis (normal
                      operation).
                       If dt is not zero, the x-axis advances by dt everytime
                      an event arrives at the event input port.
