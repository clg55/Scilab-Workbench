NAME
  scicos - Block diagram editor and GUI to hybrid simulator scicosim

CALLING SEQUENCE
  sys=scicos([sys])

PARAMETERS
  sys  : a Scicos data structure

DESCRIPTION
  scicos is a visual editor for constructing models of hybrid dynamical sys-
  tems. Invoking scicos with no argument opens up an empty scicos window.
  Models can then be assembled, loaded, saved, compiled, simulated, using GUI
  of scicos. The input and ouput arguments are only useful for debugging pur-
  poses. scicos serves as an interface to the various block diagram compilers
  and the hybrid simulator scicosim.  Here is a list of operations available
  in scicos:
  Help :   To get help on an object or menu buttons,
                click first on Help button and then on          the selected
       object or menu item.
  Edit :   Click on the Edit button to open the Edit menu.

  Simulate..
       :   Click on the Simulate.. button to open the
                compilation/execution menu.

  File..
       :   Click on the File.. button to open the file management menu.

  View :   To shift the diagram to left, right, up or down,
              click first on the View button, then on a point in
              the diagram where you want to appear in the middle
              of the graphics window.

  Exit :   Click on the Exit button to leave scicos and
                return to Scilab session. Save your diagram          before
       leaving Scicos or it will be lost.

  Palettes
       :   Click on the Palettes button to open a new palette.

  Move :   To move a block in main Scicos window,
                click first on the Move button, then          click on the
       selected block, drag the          mouse to the desired new block posi-
       tion and          click again to fix the position.           The lower
       left corner of the block is placed          at the selected point.

  Copy :   To copy a block in main Scicos window
                 Click first on the Copy button, then           click on the
       to-be-copied block (in           Scicos window or in a palette) ,  and
                 finally click where you want the copy           to be placed
       in the Scicos window.            The lower left corner of the block is
       placed           at the selected point.
  Align
       :   To obtain nice diagrams, you can align ports of
                different blocks, vertically and horizontally.
       Click first on the Align button, then on the first          port and
       finally on the second port.           The block corresponding to the
       second port is moved.           A connected block cannot be aligned.

  Link :   To connect an output port to an input port,
                click first on the Link button, then on the output
       port and finally on the input port.           To split a link, click
       first on the Link button,          then on the link where the split
       should be placed,          and finally on an input port.
       Only one link can go from and to a port.           Link color can be
       changed directly by clicking          on the link.

  Delete
       :   To delete a block or a link, click first on the Delete
                button, then on the selected object.           If you delete
       a block all links connected to it          are deleted as well.

  Flip :     To reverse the positions of the (regular) inputs            and
       outputs of a block placed on its sides,            click on the Flip
       button first and then on the            selected block. This does not
       affect the order,            nor the position of the input and output
       event            ports which are numbered from left to right.
                  A connected block cannot be flipped.

  Undo :   Click on the Undo button to undo the last edit operation.

  Replot
       :   Click on the Replot button to replot the content of
                the graphics window. Graphics window stores complete
       history of the editing session in memory.                    Replot is
       usefull for cleaning this memory.
  Back :   Click on the Back button to go back to the main menu.

  Compile
       :   Click on the Compile button to compile the block diagram.
                This button need never be used since compilation is
       performed automatically, if necessary, before          the beginning
       of every simulation (Run button).                    Normally, a new
       compilation is not needed if only          system parameters and
       internal states are modified.
                In some cases howeever modifications are not
       correctly updated and a manual compilation may be          needed
       before a Restart or a Continue.           Please report if you
       encounter such a case.

  Run  :   Click on the Run button to start the simulation.
                If the system has already been simulated, a          dialog
       box appears where you can choose to Continue,
                Restart or End the simulation.

                You may interrupt the simulation by clicking on the
       ""stop"" button, change any of the block parameters          and con-
       tinue the simulation with the new values.

  Save :    Click on the save button to save the block diagram
                 in a binary file already selected by a previous
       click on the Save As button. If you click on this           button and
       you have never clicked on the Save As           button, the diagram is
       saved in the current direcotry           as <window_name>.cos where
       <window_name> is the name           of the window appearing on top of
       the window (usually           Untitled or Super Block).

  Save As
       :   Click on the Save As button to save the block diagram
                 in a binary file. A dialog box allows choosing the
       file which must have a .cos extension. The diagram           takes the
       name of the file (without the extension).

  FSave
       :    Click on the FSave button to save the diagram
                 in a formatted ascii file. A dialog box allows
       choosing the file which must have a .cosf extension.
                 Formatted save is slower than regular save but           has
       the advantage that the generated file is           system independent
       (usefull for exchanging data           on different computers.

  Newblkn
       :    Click on the Newblk button to save the Super Block
                 as a new Scicos block. A Scilab function is generated
                 and saved in a file <window_name>.sci in a user
       palette directory. <window_name> is the name of the           Super
       Block appearing on top of the window.            A dialog allows
       choosing the palette directory.            To make Scicos recognize
       your palettes, you should           define the Scilab variable
       user_pal_dir as a column           vector of strings containing the
       paths to your           palette directories. This can, for example, be
       done           in your .scilab (user initialization) file.
       You should also make sure the functions included in           your
       palettes exists in Scilab environment before           using Scicos
       (lib or getf).

  Load :   Click on the Load button to load an ascii or binary file
                containing a saved block diagram.  A dialog box allows
                choosing the file.


  Setup
       :   In the main Scicos window, clicking on the Setup button
                invokes a dialog box that allows you to change window
                dimensions, integration parameters: absolute and
       relative error tolerances and the time tolerance          (the smal-
       lest time interval for which the ode          solver is used to update
       continuous states), and
                the simulation mode (1 or 2).           In a Super Block win-
       dow, clicking on this button
                invokes a dialog box that allows changing the window
       name (Super Block name) and window dimensions.

  New  :   Clicking on the New button loads an empty diagram in the
                main Scicos window. If the previous content of the
       window is not saved, it will be lost.
