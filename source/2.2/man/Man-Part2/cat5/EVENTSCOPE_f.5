NAME
  EVENTFSCOPE - Scicos visualization block

DESCRIPTION
  This block allows the visualization of event signals on its event input
  port(s).

DIALOG PARAMETERS
  Block label         : A string defining the block label. This label is
                      placed under the block.
  Number of inputs    : an integer, the number of event input ports.
  Curve colors        : a vector of integers. The i-th element is the color
                      number (<0) or dash type (>0) used to draw the evolu-
                      tion of the i-th input port signal. See plot2d for
                      color (dash type) definitions.
  Output window number
                      : The number of graphic window used for the display. It
                      is often good to use high values to avoid conflict with
                      palettes and Super Block windows. If you have more than
                      one scope, make sure they don't have the same window
                      numbers (unless superposition of the curves is
                      desired).
  Refresh period      : Maximum value on the X-axis (time). The plot is
                      redrawn when time reaches a multiple of this value.
