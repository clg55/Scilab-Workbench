NAME
  GENERAL - Scicos general zero crossing detector

DESCRIPTION
  Depending on the sign (just before the crossing) of the inputs and the
  input numbers of the inputs that have crossed zero, an event is programmed
  (or not) with a given delay, for each output. The number of combinations
  grows so fast that this becomes unusable for blocks having more than 2 or 3
  inputs. For the moment this block is not documented.

DIALOG PARAMETERS
  Block label         : A string defining the block label. This label is
                      written under the block.
  Number of regular inputs
                      : integer.
  Number of output events
                      : integer.
  the routing matrix  : matrix. number of rows is the number of output
                      events. The columns correspond to each possible combi-
                      nation of signs and zero crossings of the inputs. The
                      entries of the matrix give the delay for generating the
                      output event (<0 no event is generated).
