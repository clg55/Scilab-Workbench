CLSS_f(5)                       Scicos Block                       CLSS_f(5)






NAME
  CLSS - Scicos continuous-time linear state-space system

DESCRIPTION
  This block realizes a continuous-time linear state-space system.  The sys-
  tem is defined by the (A,B,C,D) matrices and the initial state x0. The
  dimensions must be compatible.

DIALOG PARAMETERS
  Block label         : A string defining the block label. This label is
                      written under the block.
  A                   : square matrix. The A matrix
  B                   : the B matrix
  C                   : the C matrix
  D                   : the D matrix
  x0                  : vector. The initial state of the system.
