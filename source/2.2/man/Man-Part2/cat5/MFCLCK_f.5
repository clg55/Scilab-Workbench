NAME
  MFCLCK - Scicos basic block for frequency division of event clock

DESCRIPTION
  This block is used in the Super Block MCLOCK. The input event is directed
  once evry n times to output 1 and the rest of the time to output 2. There
  is a delay of "Basic period" in the transmission of the event. If this
  period >0 then the second output is initially fired. It is not if this
  period=0. In the latter case, the input is driven by an event clock and in
  the former case, feedback can be used.

DIALOG PARAMETERS
  Block label    : This has no effect on this Super Block
  Basic period   : scalar.
  n              : an intger >1.
