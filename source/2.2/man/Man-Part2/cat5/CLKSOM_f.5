CLKSOM_f(5)                     Scicos Block                     CLKSOM_f(5)






NAME
  CLKSOM - Scicos event addition block

DESCRIPTION
  This block is a clock sum with up to three inputs. The output reproduces
  the events on all the input ports. Strictly speaking, CLKSOM is not a
  Scicos block because it is discarded at the compilation phase. The inputs
  and output of CLKSOM are synchronized (this is impossible for other basic
  blocks in Scicos).
