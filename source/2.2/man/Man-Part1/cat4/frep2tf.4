NAME
  frep2tf - transfer function realization of a frequency response

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [h [,err]]=frep2tf(frq,repf,dg)

PARAMETERS

  frq       : vector of frequencies

  repf      : vector of frequency response

  dg        : degree of linear system

  h         : SISO transfer function

  err       : error norm([ n(2i*pi*frq) - rep.*d(2i*pi*frq)],'fro')

DESCRIPTION
