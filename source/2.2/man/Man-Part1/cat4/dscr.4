dscr(1)                        Scilab Function                        dscr(1)






NAME
  dscr -  discretization of linear system

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [sld [,r]]=dscr(sl,dt [,m])

PARAMETERS

  sl        : syslin list containing [A,B,C,D].

  dt        : real number, sampling period

  m         : covariance of the input noise (continuous time)(default
            value=0)

  r         : covariance of the output noise (discrete time) given if m is
            given as input

  sld       : sampled (discrete-time) linear system, syslin list

DESCRIPTION
  Discretization of linear system. sl is a continuous-time system:

  dx/dt=A*x+B*u (+ noise).

  sld is the discrete-time system obtained by sampling sl with the sampling
  period dt.
