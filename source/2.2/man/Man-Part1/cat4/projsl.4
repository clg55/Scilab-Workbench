NAME
  projsl - linear system projection

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [slp]=projsl(sl,Q,M)

PARAMETERS

  sl,slp         : syslin lists

  Q,M            : matrices (projection factorization)

DESCRIPTION
  slp= projected model of sl where Q*M is the full rank factorization of the
  projection.

  If (A,B,C,D) is the representation of sl, the projected model is given by
  (M*A*Q,M*B,C*Q,D).

  Usually, the projection Q*M is obtained as the spectral projection of an
  appropriate auxiliary matrix W e.g. W = product of (weighted) gramians or
  product of Riccati equations.
