.SH DESCRIPTION
natural logarithm.If \fVx\fR is a vector \fVlog(x)=[log(x1),...,log(xn)]\fR.
If \fVx\fR is a matrix \fVlog(x)\fR is the matrix logarithm of \fVx\fR.
The result is complex if \fVx\fR is not positive or definite positive.
If \fVx\fR is a  symmetric matrix, then calculation is made by
schur form. Otherwise, \fVx\fR is assumed diagonalizable. One has
\fVexp(log(x))=x\fR
