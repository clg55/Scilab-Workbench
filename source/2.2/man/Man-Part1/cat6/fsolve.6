NAME
  fsolve - find a zero of a system of n nonlinear functions

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [x [,v [,info]]]=fsolve(x0,fct [,fjac] [,tol])

PARAMETERS

  x0        : real vector (initial value of function argument).

  fct       : external (i.e function or list or string).

  fjac      : external (i.e function or list or string).

  tol       : real scalar. precision tolerance: termination occurs when the
            algorithm estimates that the relative error between x and the
            solution is at most tol.  (tol=1.d-10 is the default value).

  x :       real vector (final value of function argument, estimated zero).

  v :       real vector (value of function at x).

  info      :  termination indicator

            0 : improper input parameters.

            1 : algorithm estimates that the relative error between x and the
              solution
               is at most tol.

            2 : number of calls to fcn reached

            3 : tol is too small. No further improvement in the approximate
              solution x is possible.

            4 : iteration is not making good progress.

DESCRIPTION
  find a zero of a system of n nonlinear functions in n variables by a modif-
  ication of the powell hybrid method. Jacobian may be provided.
  0 = fct(x) w.r.t x.
  fct is an "external".  This external returns v=fct(x) given x.

  The simplest calling sequence for fct is:
  [v]=fct(x).
  If fct is a character string, it refers to a fortran routine which must be
  linked to Scilab (see fsolvf.f for the calling sequence). Dynamic link is
  possible (help link).


  jac is an "external".  This external returns v=d(fct)/dx (x) given x.

  The simplest calling sequence for jac is:
  [v]=jac(x).
  If jac is a character string, it refers to a fortran routine which must be
  linked to Scilab (see fsolvj.f for the calling sequence). Dynamic link is
  possible (help link).
