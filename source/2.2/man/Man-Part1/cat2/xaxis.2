xaxis(2)                       Scilab Function                       xaxis(2)






NAME
  xaxis - draws an axis

CALLING SEQUENCE
  []=xaxis(alpha,nsteps,size,init)

PARAMETERS

  alpha     : real (slope in degree of the axis)

  nsteps    : real vector of size 2 (number of big and small intervals)

  size      : a real vector of size 3 (size of the intervals, the small and
            big tics)

DESCRIPTION
  Draw an axis in the alpha (in degree ) direction; nsteps ([n1,n2]) gives
  the number of big and small intervals separated by tics. size=[s1,s2,c1] :
  s1 gives the size of the intervals , s2 gives the size of the small tics
  along the axis and s2*c1 is the size of the big tics.

              ex : n1=3,n2=2,alpha =0
                                                (s2*c1)
              |     (s2)   |            |           |
              |______|_____|_____|______|_____|_____|
