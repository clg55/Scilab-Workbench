NAME
  plot3d - surface plotting

CALLING SEQUENCE
  plot3d(x,y,z,theta,alpha,leg,flag,ebox)
  plot3d(x,y,z,theta,alpha,leg,[flag,ebox)]

PARAMETERS

  x,y            : matrices of sizes (1,n1) and (1,n2) (point coordinates)

  z              : matrix of size (n1,n2) ( z(i,j) : value of f at the point
                 (x(i),y(j))

  theta, alpha   : real values giving in degree the spherical coordinates of
                 the observation point

  leg            : string (captions for each axis. this is string with @ as a
                 field separator, for example : "X@Y@Z")

  flag           : is a real vector of size three flag=[mode,type,box]

                 mode
                   : string (treatment of hidden parts)

                   mode >=2
                     the hidden parts of the surface are removed and the sur-
                     face is painted in gray (from low gray to black accord-
                     ing to the value of mode)

                   mode = 1
                     the hidden parts of the surface are drawn

                   mode <= 0
                     only the shadow of the surface is painted with a gray
                     level depending on mode

                 type
                   : scaling

                   if type = 0    the plot is made using the current 3D scal-
                                  ing ( set by a previous call to param3d,
                                  plot3d, contour, plot3d1)

                   if type = 1    the boundaries are specified by the value
                                  of the parameter

                   ebox=[xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax,zmin,zmax]

                   else the boundaries are computed with the given datas.

                 box
                   : frame display around the plot.

                   box=0
                     nothing is drawn around the plot

                   box=1
                     unimplemented ( like box=0 )

                   box=2
                     only the axes behind the surface are drawn

                   box=3
                     a box surrounding the surface is drawn and captions are
                     added

                   box=4
                     a box surrounding the surface is drawn, captions are
                     added and axes too.

DESCRIPTION
  Draw the surface f(x,y) defined by a matrix of coordinates.
