NAME
  xstring - display a matrix of strings

CALLING SEQUENCE
  []=xstring(x,y,str,[angle,flag])

PARAMETERS

  x,y            : real scalars (point coordinates)

  str            : matrix of strings

  angle          : real (angle in degree) (clockwise) (default value =0)

  flag           : integer

DESCRIPTION
  draws a matrix of strings ( each line of the matrix stands for a line of
  text and the line elements are separated by a white space) at location x,y
  ( lower-left point ) in the current graphic scale. angle if given gives the
  slope in degree to use for drawing the string. if  frame=1 a box is drawn
  around the string (only if angle=0 )

EXAMPLE
  plot2d([0,1],[0,1])
  xstring(0.5,0.5,["Scilab","is" ; "Not","Basilc"])
