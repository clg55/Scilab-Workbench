NAME
  bode - Bode plot

CALLING SEQUENCE
  bode(sl,[fmin,fmax] [,step] [,comments] )
  bode(sl,frq [,comments] )
  bode(frq,db,phi [,comments])
  bode(frq, repf  [,comments])

PARAMETERS

  sl             : syslin list (SISO or SIMO linear system) in continuous or
                 discrete time.

  fmin,fmax      : real (frequency bounds (in Hz))

  step           : real (logarithmic step.)

  comments       : vector of character strings (captions).

  frq            : row vector or matrix (frequencies (in Hz) ) (one row for
                 each SISO subsystem).

  db             : row vector or matrix ( magnitudes (in Db)).  (one row for
                 each SISO subsystem).

  phi            : row vector or matrix ( phases (in degree)) (one row for
                 each SISO subsystem).

  repf           : row vector or matrix of complex numbers (complex frequency
                 response).

DESCRIPTION
  Bode plot, i.e magnitude and phase of the frequency response of sl.

  sl can be a continuous-time or discrete-time SIMO system (see syslin).  In
  case of multi-output the outputs are plotted with different symbols.


  The frequencies are given by the bounds fmin,fmax (in Hz) or by a row-
  vector (or a matrix for multi-output) frq.


  step is the ( logarithmic ) discretization step. (see calfrq for the choice
  of default value).


  comments  is a vector of character strings (captions).


  db,phi are the matrices of modulus (in Db) and phases (in degrees). (One
  row for each response).


  repf  matrix of complex numbers. One row for each response.


  Default values for fmin and fmax are 1.d-3, 1.d+3 if sl is continuous-time
  or 1.d-3, 0.5 if sl is discrete-time.  Automatic discretization of frequen-
  cies is made by calfrq.

EXAMPLE
  s=poly(0,'s')
  h=syslin('c',(s^2+2*0.9*10*s+100)/(s^2+2*0.3*10.1*s+102.01))
  title='(s^2+2*0.9*10*s+100)/(s^2+2*0.3*10.1*s+102.01)';
  bode(h,0.01,100,title);
  h1=h*syslin('c',(s^2+2*0.1*15.1*s+228.01)/(s^2+2*0.9*15*s+225))
  bode([h1;h],0.01,100,['h1';'h'])
