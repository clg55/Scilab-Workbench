contour(2)                     Scilab Function                     contour(2)






NAME
  contour - level curves of surface

CALLING SEQUENCE
  contour(x,y,z,nz,[theta,alpha,caption,flag,bbox,zlev])

PARAMETERS

  x,y       : two real vectors of size respectively (1,n1) and (1,n2).

  z         : real matrix of size (n1,n2) (values)

  nz        : real vector of size > 1 (the level values)  or an integer ( the
            number of level curves ).

  flag      : is a real vector of size three [mode,type,box]

  zlev      : real number

  [rest]    : see plot3d

DESCRIPTION
  Draws level curves of a surface z=f(x,y). The other arguments are optional,
  they are the same as for the function plot3d (exept zlev) and their meaning
  are the same. They control the drawing of level curves on a 3D plot.  Only
  flag(1)=mode has a special meaning.

       mode=0    : the level curves are drawn on the surface defined by
                 (x,y,z)

       mode=1    : the level curves are drawn on a 3D plot and on the plan
                 defined by equation z=zlev

       mode=2    : The level curves are drawn on a 2D plot.
