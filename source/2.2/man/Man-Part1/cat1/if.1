NAME
  if then else - conditional execution

DESCRIPTION
  Conditional execution; the syntax is the following :
  if boolean then instructions,
  elseif expri then instructions,
    ....
  [else instructions],
  end

  -    The only constraint is that each then keyword must be on the same line
       line as its corresponding if or elseif keyword.

  -    The keyword then can be replaced by a carriage return or a comma.

EXAMPLE
     i=2
     for j = 1:3,
        if i == j then
          a(i,j) = 2;
        elseif abs(i-j) == 1 then
          a(i,j) = -1;
        else a(i,j) = 0;
        end,
