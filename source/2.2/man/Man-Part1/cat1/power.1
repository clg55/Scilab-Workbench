NAME
  ^  - power operation

DESCRIPTION
  For square matrices A^p is calculated by successive multiplication if p is
  a positive integer, and by diagonalization if not.  For non-square matrices
  the operation is done entry by entry.  Note that Kronecker product is noted
  .*. (e.g.  A.*.2  returns the elementwise squared A matrix).

  Note that ** can be used instead of ^.

EXAMPLE
  A=rand(2,3);A^2
  A=rand(5,5);X=A^(0.2);X^5-A
