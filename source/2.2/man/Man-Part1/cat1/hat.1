CALLING SEQUENCE
  A^b

DESCRIPTION
  Exponentiation of matrices or vectors by a constant vector.

  If A is a vector or a rectangular matrix the exponentiation is done
  element-wise, with the usual meaning.

  For square A matrices the exponentiation is done in the matrix sense.

  For boolean, polynomial and rational matrices, the exponent must be an
  integer

EXAMPLES
  2^4
  [1 2;2 4]^(1+%i)
  s=poly(0,"s");
  [1 2 s]^4
  [s 1;1  s]^(-1)
