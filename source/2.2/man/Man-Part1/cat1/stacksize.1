stacksize(1)                   Scilab Function                   stacksize(1)






NAME
  stacksize - set scilab stack size

CALLING SEQUENCE
  stacksize(n)
  szstacksize()

PARAMETERS

  n         : integer, the required stack size given in number of double pre-
            cision words

  sz        : 2-vector [total used]

DESCRIPTION
  Scilab stores all variables in a unique stack stk.

  stacksize(n) allows the user to increase or decrease this stack current
  size. The maximum allowed size depends on the amount of cpu memory and swap
  space, and on the others tools running.

  This function with the n argument may only be called at the main prompt
  time. It cannot be called within a scilab function.

  sz=stacksize() returns a 2-vector which contains  the current total and
  used stack size. It can be used everywhere.
