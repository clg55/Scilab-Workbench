rand(1)                        Scilab Function                        rand(1)






NAME
  rand - random number generator

CALLING SEQUENCE
  rand(m,n)
  rand(x)
  rand('key'[,n])

DESCRIPTION
  random matrix generator.

  rand(m,n)           is a random matrix of dimension mxn.

  rand(a)             is a random matrix of same size as a.

  rand('uniform')     is for uniform random numbers.

  rand('normal')      is for gaussian random numbers.

  rand('seed')        returns the current value of the seed.

  rand('seed',n)      puts the seed to n. (n=0 at first call).


  rand : with no arguments gives a scalar whose value changes each time it is
  referenced.  By default, random numbers are uniformly distributed in the
  interval (0,1). rand('normal') switches to a normal distribution with mean
  0 and variance 1.  rand('uniform') switches back to the uniform distribu-
  tion.
