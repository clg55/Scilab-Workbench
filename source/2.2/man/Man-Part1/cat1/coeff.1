coeff(1)                       Scilab Function                       coeff(1)






NAME
  coeff - coefficients of matrix polynomial

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [C]=coeff(Mp [,v])

PARAMETERS

  Mp        : polynomial matrix

  v         : integer (row or column) vector of selected degrees

  C         : big matrix of the coefficients

DESCRIPTION
  C=coeff(Mp) returns in a big matrix C the coefficients of the polynomial
  matrix Mp . C is partitioned as C=[C0,C1,...,Ck] where the Ci are arranged
  in increasing order k = maxi(degree(Mp))

  C=coeff(Mp,v) returns the matrix of coefficients with degree in v . (v is a
  row or column vector).
