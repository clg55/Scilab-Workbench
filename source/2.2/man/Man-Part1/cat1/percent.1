NAME
  % - percent

DESCRIPTION
  Some predefined variables begin with %, such as %i (for sqrt(-1)), %inf
  (for Infinity), %pi (for 3.14...), %T (for the boolean variable "true"),...

  In addition, functions whose names begin with % are special : they are used
  for coding (extensions of usual) operations .

  For example the function %rmr performs the multiplication (m) operation x*y
  for x and y rational matrices (r).  The coding conventions are given by the
  readme file in directory SCIDIR/macros/percent.

EXAMPLE
  x1=list('x',1,2);
  x2=list('x',2,3);
  deff('x=%xmx(x1,x2)','x=list(''x'',x1(2)*x2(2),x2(3)*x2(3))');
  x1*x2
