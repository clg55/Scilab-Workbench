NAME
  "Scilab object: matrix" - matrices in Scilab

DESCRIPTION
  Matrices are basic objects defined in Scilab.  They can be defined as fol-
  lows:
  E=[e11,e12,...,e1n;
     e21,e22,...,e2n;
          ....
     em1,em2,...,emn];
  Entries eij can be real or complex numbers, polynomials, rationals,
  strings, booleans.

  Vectors are seen as matrices with one row or one column.

  syslin lists in state-space form or transfer matrices can also be defined
  as above.

EXAMPLES
  E=[1,2;3,4]
  E=[%T,%F;1==1,1~=1]
  s=poly(0,'s');E=[s,s^2;1,1+s]
  E=[1/s,0;s,1/(s+1)]
  E=['A11','A12';'A21','A22']

  poly, string, boolean, rational, syslin, empty
