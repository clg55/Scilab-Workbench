NAME
  "Scilab object : macro" - Scilab procedure

DESCRIPTION
  Macros are Scilab procedures ("macro", "function" and "procedure" have the
  save meaning). Usually, they are defined in files with an editor and loaded
  into Scilab by getf or through a library.

  They can also be defined on-line (see deff). A file which contains a macro
  must begin as follows:
  function [y1,...,yn]=foo(x1,...,xm)
  The yi are output variables calculated as functions of input variables and
  variables existing in Scilab when the macro is executed.  A macro can be
  compiled for faster execution. Collections of macros can be collected in
  libraries.  Macros which begin with % sign (e.g. %foo) and whose arguments
  are lists are used to perform specific operations: for example, z=%rmr(x,y)
  is equivalent to z=x*y when x and z are rationals (i.e. x=list('r',n,d,[])
  with n and d polynomials).
