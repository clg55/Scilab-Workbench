h_cl(5)                        Scilab Function                        h_cl(5)






NAME
  h_cl - closed loop matrix

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [Acl]=h_cl(P,r,K)
  [Acl]=h_cl(P22,K)

PARAMETERS

  P, P22  : linear system (syslin list), augmented plant or nominal plant
          respectively

  r       : 1x2 row vector, dimensions of 2,2 part of P
          (r=[rows,cols]=size(P22))

  K       : linear system (syslin list), controller

  Acl     : real square matrix

DESCRIPTION
  Given the standard plant P (with r=size(P22)) and the controller K, this
  function returns the closed loop matrix Acl.

  The poles of Acl must be stable for the internal stability of the closed
  loop system.

  Acl is the A-matrix of the linear system [I -P22;-K I]^-1 i.e.  the A-
  matrix of lft(P,r,K)
