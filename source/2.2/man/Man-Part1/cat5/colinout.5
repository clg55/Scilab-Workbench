colinout(1)                    Scilab Function                    colinout(1)






NAME
  colinout - inner-outer factorization

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [Inn,X,Gbar]=colinout(G)

PARAMETERS

  G   : linear system (syslin list) [A,B,C,D]

  Inn :  inner factor (syslin list)

  Gbar
      :  outer factor (syslin list)

  X   :  row-compressor of G (syslin list)

DESCRIPTION
  Inner-outer factorization (and column compression) of (lxp) G =[A,B,C,D]
  with l<=p.

  G is assumed to be fat (l<=p) without zero on the imaginary axis and with a
  D matrix which is full row rank.

  G must also be stable for having Gbar stable.

  Dual of rowinout.
