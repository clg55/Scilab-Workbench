gfare(1)                       Scilab Function                       gfare(1)






NAME
  gfare - filter Riccati equation

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [Z,H]=gfare(Sl)

PARAMETERS

  Sl      : linear system (syslin list)

  Z       : symmetric matrix

  H       : real matrix

DESCRIPTION
  Generalized Filter Algebraic Riccati Equation (GFARE).  Z = solution, H =
  gain.

  The GFARE for Sl=[A,B,C,D] is:
  (A-B*D'*Ri*C)*Z+Z*(A-B*D'*Ri*C)'-Z*C'*Ri*C*Z+B*Si*B'=0
  where S=(eye+D'*D), Si=inv(S), R=(eye+D*D'), Ri=inv(R) and H=-
  (B*D'+Z*C')*Ri is such that A+H*C is stable.
