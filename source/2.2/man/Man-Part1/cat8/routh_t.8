routh_tX(1)                    Scilab Function                    routh_tX(1)






NAME
  routh_t - Routh's table

CALLING SEQUENCE
  r=routh_t(h [,k]).

PARAMETERS

  h    : square rational matrix

DESCRIPTION
  r=routh_t(h,k) computes Routh's table of denominator of the system
  described by transfer matrix SISO h with the feedback by the gain k.

  If  k=poly(0,'k') we will have a polynomial matrix with dummy variable k,
  formal expression of the Routh table.
