determ(8)                      Scilab Function                      determ(8)






NAME
  determ - determinant of polynomial matrix

CALLING SEQUENCE
  res=determ(W [,k])

PARAMETERS

  W    : real square polynomial matrix

  k    : integer (upper bound for the degree of the determinant of W)

DESCRIPTION
  res=determ(W [,k]) returns the determinant of a real polynomial matrix
  (computation made by FFT).

  k is an integer larger than the actual degree of the determinant of W.

  The default value of k is the smallest power of 2 which is larger than
  n*maxi(degree(W)).

  Method: evaluate the determinant of W for the Fourier frequencies and apply
  inverse FFT to the coefficients of the determinant.
