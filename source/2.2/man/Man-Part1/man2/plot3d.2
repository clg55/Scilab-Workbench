.SH NAME
plot3d - surface plotting
.SH CALLING SEQUENCE
.nf
plot3d(x,y,z,theta,alpha,leg,flag,ebox)
plot3d(x,y,z,theta,alpha,leg,[flag,ebox)]
.fi
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP 15
x,y
: matrices of sizes (1,n1) and (1,n2) (point coordinates)
.TP 15
z
: matrix of size (n1,n2) ( \fVz(i,j)\fR : value of f at the point (x(i),y(j))
.TP
theta, alpha 
: real values giving in degree the spherical coordinates of 
the observation point
.TP
leg 
: string (captions for each axis. this is string 
with @ as a field separator, for example : "X@Y@Z")
.TP
flag
: is a real vector of size three \fVflag=[mode,type,box]\fR
.RS 
.TP
mode 
: string (treatment of hidden parts)
.RS
.TP 
mode >=2
the hidden parts of the surface are removed and the surface is painted 
in gray (from low gray to black according to the value of mode)
.TP
mode = 1
the hidden parts of the surface are drawn 
.TP
mode <= 0
only the shadow of the surface is painted with a gray level depending
on mode
.RE
.TP
type 
: scaling
.RS 
.TP 15
if type = 0
the plot is made using the current 3D scaling ( set by a previous call to
\fVparam3d, plot3d, contour, plot3d1\fR)
.TP
if type = 1
the boundaries are specified by the value of the parameter
.LP
\fVebox=[xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax,zmin,zmax]\fR
.TP
else
the boundaries are computed with the given datas.
.RE
.TP
box
: frame display around the plot.
.RS
.TP
box=0 
nothing is drawn around the plot
.TP
box=1 
unimplemented ( like box=0 )
.TP
box=2 
only the axes behind the surface are drawn
.TP
box=3 
a box surrounding the surface is drawn and captions are added
.TP
box=4
a box surrounding the surface is drawn, captions are added and axes too.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Draw the surface \fVf(x,y)\fR defined by a matrix of coordinates.

Enter the command  \fVplot3d()\fR to see a demo.
.SH EXAMPLE

plot3d(1:10,1:20,10*rand(10,20),35,45,"X@Y@Z",[2,2,3])
