NAME
  srkf - square root Kalman filter

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [x1,p1]=srkf(y,x0,p0,f,h,q,r)

PARAMETERS

  f, h      : current system matrices

  q, r      : covariance matrices of dynamics and observation noise

  x0, p0    : state estimate and error variance at t=0 based on data up to
            t=-1

  y         : current observation Output from the function is

  x1, p1    : updated estimate and error covariance at t=1 based on data up
            to t=0

DESCRIPTION
