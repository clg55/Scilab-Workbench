mfft(1)                        Scilab Function                        mfft(1)






NAME
  mfft - multi-dimensional fft

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [xk]=mfft(x,flag,dim)

PARAMETERS

  x    : x(i,j,k,...) input signal in the form of a row vector whose values
       are arranged so that the i index runs the quickest, followed by the j
       index, etc.

  flag : (-1) FFT or (1) inverse FFT

  dim  : dimension vector which gives the number of values of x for each of
       its indices

  xk   : output of multidimensional fft in same format as for x

DESCRIPTION
  FFT for a multi-dimensional signal

  For example for a three dimensional vector which has three points along its
  first dimension, two points along its second dimension and three points
  along its third dimension the row vector is arranged as follows
       x=[x(1,1,1),x(2,1,1),x(3,1,1),
          x(1,2,1),x(2,2,1),x(3,2,1),
                x(1,1,2),x(2,1,2),x(3,1,2),
                x(1,2,2),x(2,2,2),x(3,2,2),
                      x(1,1,3),x(2,1,3),x(3,1,3),
                      x(1,2,3),x(2,2,3),x(3,2,3)]
  and the dim vector is: dim=[3,2,3]
