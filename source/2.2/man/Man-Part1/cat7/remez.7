REMEZ(G)                       Scilab Function                       REMEZ(G)






NAME
  remez - Remez's algorithm

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [an]=remez(nc,fg,ds,wt)

PARAMETERS

  nc   : integer, number of cosine functions

  fg,ds,wt
       : real vectors

  fg   : grid of frequency points in [0,.5)

  ds   : desired magnitude on grid fg

  wt   : weighting function on error on grid fg

DESCRIPTION
  minimax approximation of a frequency domain magnitude response.  The
  approximation takes the form
   h = sum[a(n)*cos(wn)]
  for n=0,1,...,nc. An FIR, linear-phase filter can be obtained from the the
  output of remez by using the following commands:
                   hn(1nc-1)=an(nc-12)/2;
                   hn(nc)=an(1);
                   hn(nc+12*nc-1)=an(2nc)/2;
  where an = cosine filter coefficients
