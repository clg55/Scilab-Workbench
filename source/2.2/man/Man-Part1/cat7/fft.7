NAME
  fft - fast fourier transform.

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [x]=fft(a,-1)
  [x]=fft(a,1)
  x=fft(a,-1,dim,incr)
  x=fft(a,1,dim,incr)

PARAMETERS

  x         : real or complex vector. Real or complex matrix (2-dim fft)

  a         : real or complex vector.

  dim       : integer

  incr      : integer

DESCRIPTION
  [1mShort     syntax (one or two dimensional fft)

  [0mx=fft(a,-1) gives a direct transform (the -1 refers to the sign of the
  exponent..., NOT to "inverse"), that is

  x(k)=sum over m of a(m)*exp(-2i*pi*m*k/n)


  for k varying from 0 to n-1 (n=size of vector a).

  (known bug fft(x,-1) for x of size 99 infinite loop!  add one or more
  zeros...)

  a=fft(x,1) performs the inverse transform normalized by 1/n.

  (fft(fft(.,-1),1) is identity).

  When the first argument given to fft is a matrix a two-dimensional FFT is
  performed.

  [1mLong syntax (multidimensional     FFT) [0mx=fft(a,-1,dim,incr) allows to perform
  an multidimensional fft.

  If a is a real or complex vector implicitly indexed by x1,x2,..,xp i.e.
  a(x1,x2,..,xp) where x1 lies in 1..dim1, x2 in 1.. dim2,... one gets a p-
  dimensional FFT p by calling p times fft as follows
   a1=fft(a ,-1,dim1,incr1)
   a2=fft(a1,-1,dim2,incr2) ...
  where dimi is the dimension of the current variable w.r.t which one is
  integrating and incri is the increment which separates two successive xi
  elements in a.

  In particular,if a is an nxm matrix, x=fft(a,-1) is equivalent to the two
  instructions:


  a1=fft(a,-1,m,1) and x=fft(a1,-1,n,m).
