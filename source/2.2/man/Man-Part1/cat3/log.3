log(1)                         Scilab Function                         log(1)






NAME
  log - logarithm

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [y]=log(x)

PARAMETERS

  x         : constant, vector or matrix

DESCRIPTION
  natural logarithm.If x is a vector log(x)=[log(x1),...,log(xn)].  If x is a
  matrix log(x) is the matrix logarithm of x.  The result is complex if x is
  not positive or definite positive.  If x is a  symmetric matrix, then cal-
  culation is made by schur form. Otherwise, x is assumed diagonalizable. One
  has exp(log(x))=x
