zeros(1)                       Scilab Function                       zeros(1)






NAME
  zeros - matrix made of zeros

CALLING SEQUENCE
  [y]=zeros(m,n)
  [y]=zeros(x)

PARAMETERS

  x,y       : matrices

  m,n       : integers

DESCRIPTION
  Matrix made of zeros (same as 0*ones).

  zeros(m,n) : for an (m,n) matrix.

  zeros(A)   : for a matrix of same size of A.

  zeros(3)   : is zeros(a) with a=3 i.e it is NOT a 3x3 matrix!

  If x is a syslin list (linear system in state-space or transfer form),
  zeros(x) is also valid and returns a zero matrix.
