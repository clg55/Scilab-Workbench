.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
A 
: real or complex square matrix
.TP
H
: real or complex square matrix
.TP
U
: orthogonal or unitary square matrix
.SH DESCRIPTION
.Vb [U,H] = hess(A)
produces a unitary matrix \fVU\fR and a Hessenberg matrix \fVH\fR so
that \fVA = U*H*U'\fR and \fVU'*U\fR = Identity.  By itself, \fVhess(A)\fR
returns \fVH\fR.
.PP
The Hessenberg form of a matrix is zero below the first 
subdiagonal. If the matrix is symmetric or
Hermitian, the form is tridiagonal.
