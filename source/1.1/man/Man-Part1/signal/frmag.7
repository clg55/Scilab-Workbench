.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
npts
: integer (number of points in frequency response)
.TP
xm
: mvector of magnitude of frequency response at the points \fVfr\fR
.TP
fr
: points in the frequency domain where
magnitude is evaluated
.TP
num
: if \fVden\fR is omitted vector coefficients/polynomial/rational
polynomial of filter
.TP
num
: if \fVden\fR is given vector coefficients/polynomial of filter numerator
.TP
den
: vector coefficients/polynomial of filter denominator
.SH DESCRIPTION
calculates the magnitude of the frequency responses of
FIR and IIR filters. The filter description can be
one or two vectors of coefficients, one or two polynomials,
or a rational polynomial.
