.SH NAME
routh_t - Routh's table
.SH CALLING SEQUENCE
.nf
r=routh_t(h [,k]).
.fi
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
h
: square rational matrix
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fVr=routh_t(h,k)\fR computes Routh's table of denominator of the
system described by transfer matrix SISO \fVh\fR with the
feedback by the gain \fVk\fR.
.LP
If  \fVk=poly(0,'k')\fR we will have a polynomial matrix with dummy variable 
\fVk\fR, formal expression of the Routh table.
