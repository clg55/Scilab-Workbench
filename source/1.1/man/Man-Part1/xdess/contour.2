.SH NAME
contour - level curves of surface
.SH CALLING SEQUENCE
.nf
contour(x,y,z,nz,[theta,alpha,caption,flag,bbox,zlev])

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP 10
x,y 
: two real vectors of size respectively (1,n1) and (1,n2).
.TP 10
z   
: real matrix of size (n1,n2) (values)
.TP 10
nz 
: real vector of size > 1 (the level values)  or an integer ( the
number of level curves ).
.TP 10
flag
: integer (0,1,2)
.TP 10
zlev
: real number
.TP 10
[rest]
: see \fVplot3d\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Draws level curves of a surface z=f(x,y). The other arguments are optional, they are the same as for the function 
\fVplot3d\fR (exept \fVzlev\fR) and their meaning are the same. They control the 
drawing of level curves on a 3D plot.
Only \fVflag(1)\fR has a special meaning.
.RS
.TP 10
flag(1)=0 
: the level curves are drawn on the surface defined by (x,y,z)
.TP
flag(1)=1
: the level curves are drawn on a 3D plot and on the plan defined by 
equation z=zlev
.TP
flag(1)=2 
: The level curves are drawn on a 2D plot.
