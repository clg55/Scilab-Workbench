******************************************************************************
			      INSTALLATION GUIDE
******************************************************************************
0 - COPYRIGHT NOTICE
********************

To use Scilab, you need to fill and return the end of the file notice.tex 
(TeX version to be compiled) or notice.ps (postscript file).

******************************************************************************
I - TO COMPILE AND INSTALL SCILAB
*********************************

   This distribution has been tested on the following machines:
    HP9000, SUN Sparcstation, IBM RS6000 and DEC mips.

   You need X11R4 or X11R5 (with Athena widgets) and a fortran compiler.

   1 - Change the variable SCIDIR in the file "Imake.incl" to make sure that 
       this variable is the path of the Scilab directory (directory where 
       Scilab distibution resides).

   2 - Execute the following commands in the Scilab directory:
	xmkmf 
	make Makefiles 
	make depend
	make distclean
	make

     This will create new Makefiles for your computer, clean the distribution,
        compile Scilab and install it.

   3 - If you want to recompile Scilab after modification, execute only 
       the "make" command.

       If you want to clean all object files and libraries and then 
       recompile Scilab, execute the following commands:
	make clean
	make

******************************************************************************
II - KNOWN PROBLEMS
*******************

   1 - If there is something wrong when you open the Xscilab window 
       then check your .Xdefault file and comment xterm*geometry statements.
       Do the same in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Xterm

   2 - The fortran compiler version 1.3.1 of SUN Sparcstations has a bug:
       reading or writing (with implicit loop) arrays  bigger than 4096 
       elements does not work. This may cause Scilab to abort.
       The solution is to upgrade your fortran compiler, for instance get 
       version 1.4 (or use version 1.3.1 with object file "recio.o" from 
       newer version).

******************************************************************************
III - TO RUN SCILAB
*******************

Run Scilab by executing "xscilab" or "scilab" (shell script in SCIDIR/bin).

******************************************************************************
IV - DOCUMENTATION
****************** 

In addition to Scilab online documentation, you will find
documentation in SCIDIR/doc/intro (file intro.ps) and 
                 SCIDIR/man/LaTex-doc (file Docu.ps).

V - CONTENT OF THE DIRECTORIES
******************************

Main Directory (SCIDIR)

scilab.star: startup file for Scilab: instructions in this file
               are executed when Scilab is launched. This file is 
               made automatically by the main Makefile.

Imakefile: the main Imakefile.

Imake.incl: the file included by Imakefile. It can be modified by the user.

Makefile: the main Makefile to make Scilab automatically generated by
           imake.

demos/    : demos directory.

macros/   : macros directory: this directory is divided into 
                subdirectories corresponding to specific topics
                (control,polynomials,...). Each subdirectory contains 
		the source code of the macros (files *.sci). 

xmetanet/ : Metanet routines.
libs/	  : directory of libraries: archives of object files necessary 
             to link Scilab.

routines/ : directory of fortran or c routines. Divided into subdirectories
             (see below).

doc/      : directory of documentation. Usually Latex files.

man/	  : man files.

tests/    : set of exec files to test Scilab.

util/     : useful routines and ASCII files to manage Scilab.

bin/	  : executable code.
		scilab: shell-script to call Scilab
		xscilab: shell-script to call Xscilab
		scihelp: man help of Scilab
        	xscihelp: X11 interface to scihelp
		scilex: executable code of Scilab

xsci/     : Unix xterm adapted to Scilab and FIG : Facility for Interactive 
             Generation of figures (Xfig).

VI - TO CREATE YOUR OWN CUSTOMIZED SCILAB
*****************************************
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   USE YOUR OWN FORTRAN ROUTINES IN SCILAB
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Directory SCIDIR/routines

stack.h    : this file is included in many fortran programs of subdirectories
             of "SCIDIR/routines". The size of the internal Scilab stack is 
             defined here. This is given in the parameter vsiz. 
             The default value is 300000. You can change it.

Directory SCIDIR/routines/default

matusr.f   : interface to add your own commands to Scilab (see the user 
             command).
interf.f   :interface for fast call to a fortran routine (see the fort command
            and the link command)
 
Other routines in this directory are used to interface external fortran
routines for use with the functions ode (non linear simulation), optim (non
linear optimization), intg (definite integrals), impl (implicit systems) and
schur (schur form with ordering defined by a fortran routine).
	
To use your own routines you need to replace the 
code .o in the directory SCIDIR/routines/default by your own code.

The libraries are the following:

    -system.a is the interpreter.
    -interf.a is the set of routines which interface the interpreter with
              the calculation routines.
    -system2.a is a set of utility routines for the interpreter.
    -control.a signal.a poly.a optim.a integ.a and calelm.a are the routines
      for numerical calculations.
    -X11c.a  and xwindow.a are the routines for graphics.
    -sun.a contains specific routines for Unix (some of them are not portable
      e.g. the incremental linking routines).
